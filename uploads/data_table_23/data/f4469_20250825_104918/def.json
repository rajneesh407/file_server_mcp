Next steps: check your latest statement for the fee, then call or secureâ€‘message customer service and politely request an annual fee waiver or retention offer; have your account number and recent activity ready.

Cash withdrawn at ATMs is often treated as a cash advance (which can carry a cash-advance fee and different interest terms) and ATM operators may charge their own fee. I can see your Visa card is active and international usage is enabled, with a usage limit of 300 â€” that likely affects ATM/withdrawal limits. Recommendations: use the card for purchases when possible, avoid frequent ATM withdrawals, withdraw larger amounts to reduce per-withdrawal fees, always choose to be charged in the local currency (decline dynamic currency conversion), and use bank/partner ATMs when available.

You can usually pay a credit card bill via NEFT/IMPS from a bank account, but moving money from a credit card to a bank account (cash advance or card-to-account transfers) is restricted, varies by issuer, and often has fees and limits.

NEFT and IMPS are bank-to-bank transfer systems that move money from a bank account (or via a linked debit instrument), so credit cards arenâ€™t typically used directly for NEFT/IMPS. Some banks/issuers offer exceptionsâ€”e.g., card-to-bank transfers or cash-advance products that deposit to an accountâ€”but those are limited, often come with high fees and interest, and arenâ€™t supported by every card.

Some banks offer a â€œcard-to-bankâ€ transfer or cash-advance option that can move money to a bank account, but those are treated as cash advances (usually subject to high fees and immediate interest) and arenâ€™t universally available.

Whether points can be transferred between cards depends on your bank and the specific rewards program. Common rules are: both cards usually must be on the same rewards program and typically owned by the same primary account holder (some banks allow household pooling); transfers to other customers are often prohibited; there can be minimum/maximum transfer amounts, fees, promotional points that canâ€™t be moved, and expiration or blackout rules. Next steps you can take right now: sign in to the bankâ€™s rewards portal and look for â€œcombine,â€ â€œtransfer,â€ or â€œpool points,â€ or call the number on the back of your card and ask rewards support for transfer/limit rules.
