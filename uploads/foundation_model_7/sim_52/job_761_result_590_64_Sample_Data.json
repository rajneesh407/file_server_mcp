However, this has not necessarily reduced the amount of total revenue collected in income tax (see LAFFER CURVE). Nor do governments that have reduced income tax rates always cut other sorts of taxes; on the contrary, they have often increased them sharply to make up for any revenue lost as a result of lower rates of income tax.","Regulatory and Compliance","A tax levied by a government directly on an individual's or company's income, often with different rates for different income levels or types of income.",49.29,"4\n","A mandatory levy imposed by governments on individuals, corporations, or other entities' earnings or profits, which must be calculated, reported, and paid in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations; noncompliance can result in penalties or legal action.",33.3,"4\n","A mandatory charge imposed by a government on the financial income of individuals, corporations, trusts, and other legal entities within its jurisdiction.
