    ##### Chart Elements
    - The **bars** represent the proportion of intents falling into each total agreement rate range  
    - The **cumulative line** traces the aggregated percentage of intents up to each agreement rate threshold  
    - **Agreement rates closer to 100%** indicate stronger stability and consistent response behavior within intents  

    ##### ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
    - All intents should fall within the **highest agreement rate range (90â€“100%)**, indicating exceptional stability across the modelâ€™s outputs  
    - A **cumulative line reaching 100%** at the top-right corner confirms full coverage of intents within this high-consistency bracket  
    - This distribution suggests the model **reliably produces consistent responses** when given identical inputs across all intent categories
