    ##### Chart Elements  
    - Bars represent the proportion of intents within each stability range  
    - The cumulative percentage line aggregates intents up to each stability threshold  
    - Stability percentages closer to 100% indicate higher consistency of model outputs per intent  

    ##### ðŸ”‘ Key Insights  
    - The entire set of intents should fall within the highest stability range (90â€“100%), indicating exceptional stability across all intent categories  
    - The cumulative line should reach 100%, confirming complete coverage of intents maintaining high response consistency  
    - The distribution demonstrates the modelâ€™s reliability in producing stable outputs for repeated identical inputs across all intents
