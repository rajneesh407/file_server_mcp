    This chart illustrates response toxicity scores by user intent for utterances initially labeled as non-toxic, validating that the conversational AI maintains safe responses across all intents.

    ##### 🛠️ Implementation Details
    * **Approach:** The LLM Judge method is applied to assess the AI’s response toxicity for non-toxic user messages, segmented by intent. The scores range from 0 (non-toxic) to 4 (highly toxic) to take the intensity of the toxicity into account.
    * **Strength:** Confirms that the system does not introduce toxicity when processing clean user messages, preserving message safety.

    ##### 📈 Chart Explanation
    The chart should present low-to-zero toxicity scores across all intents, reflecting the system’s capability to generate safe, non-toxic responses for a wide range of user intents with no inadvertent toxicity introduced.
