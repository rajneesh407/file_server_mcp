    ##### Purpose
    This chart identifies which attack dimensions most successfully bypass defenses. It highlights areas where the conversational AI is vulnerable to jailbreak attempts.

    ##### Process
    * Calculates the percentage of responses classified as violations (jailbreak successful) for each attack dimension.
    * Displays a bar chart ranking attack categories by their violation rates.
    * Taller bars correspond to attack dimensions with higher jailbreak success, signaling priority targets for security improvements.

    This visualization supports focused defensive efforts by clearly showing where the modelâ€™s safeguards are weakest against malicious prompt exploitation. A perfectly safe model should have 0 values for all attack dimensions.
