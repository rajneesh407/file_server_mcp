Compliance Distribution check: Checking to ensure data distribution is meeting expectations including checks for outlier or bad data. Correctness Logic check: Ensuring that logic of feature definition is correct and is not duplicated already in the feature library. Performance Performance check: Checks to ensure that code would run in production in a performant way on large datasets. Left Shift Testing for Decisions: Model Level: As a business and compliance check, if the process is setup that all features that are driving a model have been tested 'at-source' and have been approved upstream once for use many times downstream, this can dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the testing process at the model level.\"}, {'document_title': 'Bits & Banks - With Aditya Khandekar and Alissa Sykes - Episode 4', 'document_uri': 'https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-and-alissa-sykes-episode-4', 'text': 'Challenges?
