Before the onset of Covid-19, large financial institutions had more than adequate capital to withstand a reasonably severe economic environment. This \u2013 coupled with timely government assistance, proactive cost control and customer assistance actions taken during the pandemic \u2013 have allowed these institutions so far to remain healthy.\n\nFin-techs, especially those that had kept the loans on their books \u2013 but had not invested in adequate end-to-end credit risk controls \u2013 have suffered due to the absence of liquidity and limited demand for new loans, along with a sharp rise in credit losses. Many have been restructured and merged with larger institutions.\n\nLooking ahead, the environment remains uncertain and can quickly morph into a more serious downturn. Good preparation now is essential for survival and success.\n\n### **Uncertainty Ahead**\n\nThe positive impact of early actions has served its intended purpose. There is a distinct possibility that the key drivers of economy and the associated credit losses could worsen in the coming months. Both consumers and small businesses could face a liquidity crunch as savings deplete with time. Even the large financial institutions with solid capital strength could face challenges, in a bad scenario. Many larger companies that have held off on reductions in staff will have to let employees go in coming months.\n\nThe coming months are likely to create anxiety for all participants \u2013 borrowers, lenders, and investors. It remains uncertain:\n\n- How Covid 19 will mutate \u2013 the trends to date do not show any signs of it \u2018going away\u2019.\n\n- The possibility of a vaccine or cure \u2014 will it be available quickly on a global basis?\n\n- How broad, deep and long the next set of government assistance programs will be.\n\n- The regulatory thinking and guidance for the financial institutions in terms of capital standards, stress tests, stock buybacks, and levels of credit reserves?\n\n\nThe environment can become even more complicated if a clear winner is not established following the November presidential election. This uncertainty could accelerate and deepen these adverse trends.\n\n### **Risk Management Professionals Beware**\n\nWe are in uncharted territory where we could experience serious adverse outcomes. At the same time, clear thinking and focused action can create decades of lead over competitors in the way we serve customers and control risk.\n\nThis environment has no historic parallel, For example:\n\n- Key economic measures \u2013 GDP growth, Unemployment rate \u2013 have become uncorrelated with credit losses. The economic measures are at or close to historic **worst levels**, but the credit write-off rate remains near historic\n\n- Eight months into this cycle, there is limited visibility on where the economy is headed.\n\n- Large volumes of forbearance programs with inconsistent reporting standards (to credit bureaus) have decoupled the relationship between \u2013 delinquency and credit loss, Fico score and the probability of default, the definition of subprime and super-prime customer \u2013 among others.\n\n\nRisk management and finance professionals have to ask:\n\n- How do we realistically forecast credit losses and risk-adjusted margins to support mid-year Fed mandated stress tests? Or to book adequate reserves? Deep expertise is required to ensure that these forecasts are bounded within narrow guardrails.\n\n- How do I have any confidence that the current \u2018models and rules\u2019 in place, for ongoing risk management, are effective.\n\n- What are the optimal ways to learn from this environment both immediately and for the medium term?\n\n\nCredit losses, across the board, could rise way faster than the current level of reserves. Alternatively, we might be grossly over-reserved and lose important business momentum. It might become difficult to offer loans at reasonable interest rates. Investors could feel added pressure from reductions in asset prices.\n\nEven established financial institutions could face serious challenges. Fin-techs with inadequate risk management investments could face even worse survival challenges. Well managed institutions could, of course, turn out to be large winners at the expense of weaker competitors.\n\n### **What You Should Do Now:**\n\nRegardless of your beliefs in the seriousness of the economic downturn or the duration of uncertainty, you should act now and tweak your thinking over time.\n\n##### Reinforce the most important credit risk management themes:\n\n- Good Credit risk management is not just effective underwriting but end to end management through collections.\n\n- Make sure the risk policy and risk operations are in complete alignment with each other \u2013 through continual idea and information exchange.\n\n- With discipline, monitor model discrimination, \u2018rule\u2019 performance, and portfolios.\n\n- Do an end-to-end review of your entire control process to address weak spots.\n\n\nIt is easy to become complacent right now given very low level of credit losses. I do believe that complacency could have serious adverse outcomes.\n\n##### Invest in data and technology now to ensure that:\n\n- You have visibility into your \u2018true\u2019 credit risk performance \u2013 now and in the medium term \u2013 corrected for the impact of forbearance and government assistance.\n\n- You have flexible and nimble analytics and execution platforms \u2013 to make segmented short-term adjustments to your models and \u2018rules\u2019, by industry, loan type (e.g. auto loan, unsecured loan) geography, Covid spread \u2013 with full regulatory compliance (90% of the institutions do not).\n\n- You have fully functioning \u2018test and learn\u2019 capabilities.\n\n- Analytics are put into production instantly \u2026 time is of the essence here.\n\n- You are learning from this environment and building for the medium term.\n\n\nBe thoughtful as to what you can build in-house and what is best to buy. My general view is that:\n\n- \u2018Data\u2019, \u2018decision scientists\u2019, and \u2018expert credit professionals\u2019 must be owned assets. You might still seek external expertise to strengthen these assets \u2013 the key here is to not outsource these critical drivers.\n\n- On the other hand, certain risk management platforms \u2013 model studios and Workflow management capabilities \u2013 are best outsourced since they are very expensive to build or keep current. Here you should develop expertise to leverage them but avoid building them inhouse.\n\n\nPerhaps most important, recognize the urgency and need to act.\n\nOver the last couple of years, I have been involved in building a technology that allows you to make quick and thoughtful adjustments to your models and rules with full regulatory compliance along with instant conversion from analytics to production to monitoring. This capability \u2013 **Corridor Platforms** ( [www.corridorplatforms.com](http:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/)) is one of the most advanced mechanisms for this transformation.

Deep expertise is required to ensure that these forecasts are bounded within narrow guardrails.\n\n- How do I have any confidence that the current \u2018models and rules\u2019 in place, for ongoing risk management, are effective.\n\n- What are the optimal ways to learn from this environment both immediately and for the medium term?\n\n\nCredit losses, across the board, could rise way faster than the current level of reserves. Alternatively, we might be grossly over-reserved and lose important business momentum. It might become difficult to offer loans at reasonable interest rates. Investors could feel added pressure from reductions in asset prices.\n\nEven established financial institutions could face serious challenges. Fin-techs with inadequate risk management investments could face even worse survival challenges. Well managed institutions could, of course, turn out to be large winners at the expense of weaker competitors.\n\n### **What You Should Do Now:**\n\nRegardless of your beliefs in the seriousness of the economic downturn or the duration of uncertainty, you should act now and tweak your thinking over time.\n\n##### Reinforce the most important credit risk management themes:\n\n- Good Credit risk management is not just effective underwriting but end to end management through collections.\n\n- Make sure the risk policy and risk operations are in complete alignment with each other \u2013 through continual idea and information exchange.\n\n- With discipline, monitor model discrimination, \u2018rule\u2019 performance, and portfolios.\n\n- Do an end-to-end review of your entire control process to address weak spots.\n\n\nIt is easy to become complacent right now given very low level of credit losses. I do believe that complacency could have serious adverse outcomes.\n\n##### Invest in data and technology now to ensure that:\n\n- You have visibility into your \u2018true\u2019 credit risk performance \u2013 now and in the medium term \u2013 corrected for the impact of forbearance and government assistance.\n\n- You have flexible and nimble analytics and execution platforms \u2013 to make segmented short-term adjustments to your models and \u2018rules\u2019, by industry, loan type (e.g. auto loan, unsecured loan) geography, Covid spread \u2013 with full regulatory compliance (90% of the institutions do not).\n\n- You have fully functioning \u2018test and learn\u2019 capabilities.\n\n- Analytics are put into production instantly \u2026 time is of the essence here.\n\n- You are learning from this environment and building for the medium term.\n\n\nBe thoughtful as to what you can build in-house and what is best to buy. My general view is that:\n\n- \u2018Data\u2019, \u2018decision scientists\u2019, and \u2018expert credit professionals\u2019 must be owned assets. You might still seek external expertise to strengthen these assets \u2013 the key here is to not outsource these critical drivers.\n\n- On the other hand, certain risk management platforms \u2013 model studios and Workflow management capabilities \u2013 are best outsourced since they are very expensive to build or keep current. Here you should develop expertise to leverage them but avoid building them inhouse.\n\n\nPerhaps most important, recognize the urgency and need to act.\n\nOver the last couple of years, I have been involved in building a technology that allows you to make quick and thoughtful adjustments to your models and rules with full regulatory compliance along with instant conversion from analytics to production to monitoring. This capability \u2013 **Corridor Platforms** ( [www.corridorplatforms.com](http:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/)) is one of the most advanced mechanisms for this transformation. Early results have shown outstanding outcomes for complex financial institutions. I would urge you to evaluate its usefulness in your environment.\n\n[Bits & Banks - With Aditya Khandekar and Mike Kelly - Episode 3](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-and-mike-kelly-episode-3)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Reva Rao - Episode 2](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-reva-rao-episode-2)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Kevin Moss - Episode 1](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-kevin-moss)\n\n[Contact Us](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/contact-us)\n\n[GenGuardX](https:\/\/ggx.corridorplatforms.com\/)\n\nbottom of page\n\nWe use cookies on our website to see how you interact with it.

Auditability of decision post-fact is difficult due to lack of systematic capability to maintain policy revision history._\n\n##### **Corridor Solutions**:\n\nFinally, once the refined policy is ready to deploy to production, the platform allows the policy writer to quickly orchestrate the configuration of deployment through the execution portal and then extract a standalone artifact which can be deployed seamlessly in the bank\u2019s production system using direct calls to the artifact or calling an API wrapped around the artifact.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_ef47e755e4ab41bda5379160a61e58e6~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_23,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_ef47e755e4ab41bda5379160a61e58e6~mv2.png)\n\nIn addition, the artifact also facilitates auditability of decision post-fact, which is important if the decision logic needs to be validated by the regulators or internal compliance for past acquisitions. The platform maintains all versions of policies as well as associated models, features and data elements to drive clear transparency for the decision logic if it needs to be created. See an example below:\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_b5899618a42c4dafbe68107084b4f221~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_24,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_b5899618a42c4dafbe68107084b4f221~mv2.png)\n\nFinally, Corridor Platforms enables the vision of an integrated decision platform where processes for the end-to-end decision cycle are streamlined through full connectivity, automation, systematic governance and standardized workflows, and enable speed and agility required for fully digital decisions processes.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_0ce6ebfa8c6b4b3bb2d63df5d9d457ad~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_62,h_59,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_0ce6ebfa8c6b4b3bb2d63df5d9d457ad~mv2.png)\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nUsing the integrated decisioning platform, banks can compliantly incorporate new and alternate sources of data; migrate to faster machine learning models and big data; and make decision and strategy changes quickly to react to the economy, competition, and consumer needs. These are exactly the capabilities needed to act with speed and safety to get through the crisis.\n\n[Bits & Banks - With Aditya Khandekar and Mike Kelly - Episode 3](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-and-mike-kelly-episode-3)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Reva Rao - Episode 2](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-reva-rao-episode-2)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Kevin Moss - Episode 1](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-kevin-moss)\n\n[Contact Us](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/contact-us)\n\n[GenGuardX](https:\/\/ggx.corridorplatforms.com\/)\n\nbottom of page\n\nWe use cookies on our website to see how you interact with it.

With an expectation of multiple waves for Covid-19, banks will need to constantly adjust their models and strategies in risk and marketing and have heightened monitoring capabilities so as to quickly evaluate impact scenarios and make refinements while enhancing compliance and governance.\n\nThis is a critical time for banks to design and implement adaptive risk management with nimble processes, integrated decision systems, adopt new data with compliance and have the willingness to experiment strategies with close monitoring (\u201ctest-and-learn\u201d).\n\n**_Speed of response while ensuring safety (compliance) is going to be a competitive imperative for banks to survive and stay ahead of peers for the next 18-24 months_** _._\n\n[Corridor Platforms](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/) is a leading [decision workflow governance and automation capability](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/) designed by industry veterans to rapidly transform risk and marketing decisioning at banks, enabling them to leverage new data, AI and automation to create competitive excellence in revenue growth, risk control and operating efficiency in the age of digitization. The platform offers [full connectivity between data, features, models and policies with systemic governance and control](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/principle\/) at every step in the decision lifecycle.\n\nIn this blog, we will showcase an end-to-end decision cycle for underwriting on the [Corridor Platform](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/platform\/) which incorporates new crisis centric data in compliance, monitors existing models by segments for degradation, rewires existing strategies quickly with impact assessment and finally, deploy to production in real-time with full auditability of decisions.\n\n## **Step 1 \u2013 Incorporate Crisis Indicator with Compliance**\n\n##### **Pain Point**:\n\n_Banks struggle to rapidly bring in new data sources with the safety of compliance, control permissible use of data by modelling and policy teams systematically to ensure a robust governed environment to make policy decisions._\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**:\n\nBanks can rapidly connect to external data like [epidemiology crisis intensity](https:\/\/www.oliverwyman.com\/our-expertise\/insights\/2020\/apr\/covid-19-pandemic-navigator.html) indicators or bureau forbearance data with sophisticated data modelling (primary, secondary indices) so as to integrate that with banks internal and bureau level attributes at the applicant\/customer level.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_7cea1c27faa4431db11c99d545ac0788~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_740,h_416,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_7cea1c27faa4431db11c99d545ac0788~mv2.png)\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_d03c926e75f94c2aac11d1019dd3a580~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_740,h_316,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_d03c926e75f94c2aac11d1019dd3a580~mv2.png)\n\nOnce incorporated, data elements and\/or features based on these new data sources can be quickly registered and tested for compliance such as FCRA compliance for age and gender.\n\nIn addition, the platform has the ability to maintain lineages (upstream and downstream) of usage of system entities and track permissible use violations automatically. See example below where Forbearance flag usage across features, models and policies is tracked automatically by the platform and flagged for permissible use violations.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_0ce8e75c757c420c9e1e41641ad43e1f~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_21,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_0ce8e75c757c420c9e1e41641ad43e1f~mv2.png)\n\n## **Step 2 \u2013 Setup segmental model tracking and automate degradation alerts**\n\n##### **Pain Point**:\n\n_Model tracking process is mostly manual and time-consuming at banks due to inefficiencies across systems and lack of standardization. This leads to delays in identifying model degradation issues in a fast-evolving consumer landscape currently and the ability to react quickly._\n\n##### **Corridor Solution:**\n\nThe platform allows sophisticated ML-based probability of default models for loan applicants to be registered and governed on the platform. The platform also has automated and standardized performance dashboards that can be run for models, which hastens the approval and\/or feedback process & reduces compliance friction and inefficiencies. See an example of a standardized dashboard here.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_448265ca0b6e416eb205602f0dea8e57~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_27,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_448265ca0b6e416eb205602f0dea8e57~mv2.png)\n\nIn addition, the platform allows for the setup of automated model tracking by segments to monitor the degradation of performance and triggers when risk corridors (floor or ceiling) are breached. The example here sets up tracking for \u2018Severe\u2019 affected states with AUC threshold of 0.55.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_cc40c95a68334b23a3167c1f7e166391~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_77,h_48,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_cc40c95a68334b23a3167c1f7e166391~mv2.png)\n\nAs the [ROC](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Receiver_operating_characteristic) curve indicates, the model performance for the \u2018Severe\u2019 segment has become unstable relative to the comparison benchmark.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_e6761a086fe5438e99ca4dcb9b5f35b5~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_14,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_e6761a086fe5438e99ca4dcb9b5f35b5~mv2.png)\n\n## **Step 3 \u2013 Strategy Rewiring for Crisis Segment and Evaluate Impact**\n\n##### **Pain Point**:\n\n_Policy writing systems are generally siloed at the bank, requiring data movement across systems and multiple checks and balances for compliances and testing scenarios prior to approval._\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**:\n\nNow that we realize that the PD model is not very stable for the \u2018Severe\u2019 segment, we want to tighten up the policy cut-offs for that segment. This is easy to perform using the policy engine of the platform where approved and compliant attributes can be easily incorporated as segments.

More often than not, these optimizing prospecting decisions need to be made in a real-time digital setting with the flexibility around offer management against competing offers from other banks and Fintech's.\n\n## **What is Corridor Platforms?**\n\n[Corridor Platforms](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/) is a leading decision workflow governance and automation capability designed by industry veterans to rapidly transform risk and marketing decisioning at banks, enabling them to leverage new data, AI and automation to create competitive excellence in revenue growth, risk control and operating efficiency in the age of digitization. The platform offers [full connectivity between data, features, models and strategies with systemic governance and control](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/principle\/) at every step in the decision lifecycle.\n\n## **Prospecting campaign with optimized offers**\n\nIn this use case, we will showcase the development of an end-to-end prospecting strategy on Corridor Platforms which leverages sophisticated lifetime value frameworks to optimize offers to prospects in real time with flexible offer management to effectively compete against competitive offers. The schematic diagram below shows how the Corridor driven prospecting strategies enables real time offer generation.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_3cff6cdb5b7c42c688d4090fec201f9e~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_740,h_497,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_3cff6cdb5b7c42c688d4090fec201f9e~mv2.png)\n\nIn the following section, we will cover the steps to set up a prospecting campaign on Corridor to generate optimized offers to prospects.\n\n### **Step 1 \u2013 Setup the product to be offered to the prospect**\n\nCorridor has flexible capability to set up product types (or categories) such as credit cards, installment loans with configuration parameters defining the product type. Then, specific products can be instantiated from the product type. In the example below, \u201836month installment loan\u2019 and a \u2018platinum credit card\u2019 are instantiated as the two potential products to be offered to prospects.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_95d5b7557ee942c7b770dee78c3450c6~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_740,h_269,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_95d5b7557ee942c7b770dee78c3450c6~mv2.jpg)\n\n### **Step 2 \u2013 Setup the prospect estimated LTV (Life Time Value) framework**\n\nThe policy writer can set up a sophisticated custom framework to calculate LTV of prospects. The framework takes a set of inputs (described below), a custom logic for calculation of LTV and outputs the estimated discounted cash flows which are then used in the valuation function to calculate the LTV for each offer configuration.\n\n**Inputs to LTV framework**\n\n- Product parameters\n\n- Response model\n\n- Acceptance model\n\n- Acquisition cost\n\n- Cost of funds\n\n- Prospect data\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_bfa02cf7e07d438f815f1840ef347505~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_76,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_bfa02cf7e07d438f815f1840ef347505~mv2.jpg)\n\n**LTV custom logic**\n\nSample of the logic code is displayed below. While this is an illustration, the framework writer has strong flexibility to write powerful custom frameworks to be used in policies.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_592fab011d374b998d94c053e356a9ac~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_112,h_66,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_592fab011d374b998d94c053e356a9ac~mv2.jpg)\n\n**Output of the LTV framework**\n\nThe framework logic outputs the estimated discounted cash flows of the prospect which are then used to calculate the LTV of the prospect through the Valuation Function. See screenshots below.\n\n- Net Cash flow\n\n- Acquisition cost\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_b83b993b43fe4d389029cbca75bbf0ef~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_62,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_b83b993b43fe4d389029cbca75bbf0ef~mv2.jpg)\n\nThese outputs are then used to calculate the LTV and used by the policy for each prospect.\n\n### **Step 3 \u2013 Setup a policy with strategies to optimize the offer to prospect**\n\nProspecting policy setup: As the first step, register the prospecting policy through the prospecting module and set up the offer generator, the prospect LTV framework and models to be used for defining the optimization strategy. See screenshots below.\n\n**Offer generator setup**\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_160c2fe9ae384045a9ea53fbd9cb133d~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_74,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_160c2fe9ae384045a9ea53fbd9cb133d~mv2.jpg)\n\n**LTV Framework and model setup in the policy**\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_8ef218a64ceb480a8add27b8f7a5b959~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_61,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_8ef218a64ceb480a8add27b8f7a5b959~mv2.jpg)\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_bf75eb1846a241f08d21d639a62dabf9~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_51,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_bf75eb1846a241f08d21d639a62dabf9~mv2.jpg)\n\n### **Step 4- Develop a product selection offer strategy that maximizes prospect estimated value**\n\nDevelop an optimization strategy which iterates in real-time offers with varying credit limits and rates for two offered products of Installment Loan 36 months (IL\\_36) and Platinum Credit Card (PL\\_CC) and selects a product that maximizes the estimated lifetime value of prospect with a constraint of rate ceiling.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_38bd0bf9215e4a2cad6a7234f71cedee~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_44,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_38bd0bf9215e4a2cad6a7234f71cedee~mv2.jpg)\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_c835303940194c68be542546342e3873~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_37,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_c835303940194c68be542546342e3873~mv2.jpg)\n\n### **Step 5- Testing real time execution scenarios for product selection in offers**\n\nRunning various scenarios of execution of the strategy for offer generation, for a $50,000 loan, the expected lifetime value of an installment loan is higher than a platinum credit card (factoring in the response and acceptance propensities of prospect) and hence the product offered is the IL\\_36 over the PL\\_CC.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_5b2c05337d094a16932647ee2a63e140~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_65,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_5b2c05337d094a16932647ee2a63e140~mv2.jpg)\n\n### **Step 6- Offer display management when multiple offers qualify for the prospect**\n\nIn scenarios where multiple offers can be offered to the prospect, Corridor has the capability to flexibly manage rank ordering of offers that should be presented to the client. In the context of this use case, we have configured the following scenario:\n\n- If prospect FICO => 750, show them one offer that has the highest LTV of prospect across range of offer amounts\n\n- If prospect FICO < 750, show them a max offer of $40,000 loan amount across the products (IL or CC), to maximize the revenue potential and focus less on maximizing LTV.\n\n\nThe offer display logic screenshot in shown below:\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_a07346a974624b9aba20d990ecfac5e7~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_47,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_a07346a974624b9aba20d990ecfac5e7~mv2.jpg)\n\nWhile this example is an illustration, highly custom display logic (by segments as required) can be configured in the offer display module to give the ultimate \u201csegment-of-1\u201d offer customization capability to the policy writer.\n\nAs an example run, for a prospect with FICO = 720, the above display configuration results in 1 final offer being presented to the prospect at $40,000 loan amount.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_fa36e687cf074aadb9b74b34df261a5b~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_55,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_fa36e687cf074aadb9b74b34df261a5b~mv2.jpg)\n\nIn addition, the display management logic can be enhanced to factor in external competitive offers and its impact on uptake rate for the banks offer, making the offer display logic dynamic to evolving competitive and market dynamics.\n\n### **Step 7- Deployment of analytics to production quickly and continuously refinement over time**\n\nOnce the analytics is built and approved through banks\u2019 custom approval workflows on the platform, Corridor stitches together a standalone artifact which incorporates all the dependent models, features and data elements required to enable the analytics for the prospecting policy.\n\nThe artifact can then easily be called in batch or real time model flexibly by production deployment systems to enable the full use case. See schematic below for the overall process flow to stitch the artifact and extract for production deployment.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_63247e64089c4b92a854f4b87df05b3a~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_88,h_43,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_63247e64089c4b92a854f4b87df05b3a~mv2.png)\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWe have demonstrated the ease of rapidly building a sophisticated prospecting policy from scratch on Corridor, with flexibility of display management in-built into the analytics and the ability to quickly move analytics to production systems without the need to re-test or re-code and reduce the overall cycle time to market.\n\n[Bits & Banks - With Aditya Khandekar and Mike Kelly - Episode 3](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-and-mike-kelly-episode-3)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Reva Rao - Episode 2](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-reva-rao-episode-2)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Kevin Moss - Episode 1](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-kevin-moss)\n\n[Contact Us](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/contact-us)\n\n[GenGuardX](https:\/\/ggx.corridorplatforms.com\/)\n\nbottom of page\n\nWe use cookies on our website to see how you interact with it.

In the example below, \u201836month installment loan\u2019 and a \u2018platinum credit card\u2019 are instantiated as the two potential products to be offered to prospects.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_95d5b7557ee942c7b770dee78c3450c6~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_740,h_269,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_95d5b7557ee942c7b770dee78c3450c6~mv2.jpg)\n\n### **Step 2 \u2013 Setup the prospect estimated LTV (Life Time Value) framework**\n\nThe policy writer can set up a sophisticated custom framework to calculate LTV of prospects. The framework takes a set of inputs (described below), a custom logic for calculation of LTV and outputs the estimated discounted cash flows which are then used in the valuation function to calculate the LTV for each offer configuration.\n\n**Inputs to LTV framework**\n\n- Product parameters\n\n- Response model\n\n- Acceptance model\n\n- Acquisition cost\n\n- Cost of funds\n\n- Prospect data\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_bfa02cf7e07d438f815f1840ef347505~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_76,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_bfa02cf7e07d438f815f1840ef347505~mv2.jpg)\n\n**LTV custom logic**\n\nSample of the logic code is displayed below. While this is an illustration, the framework writer has strong flexibility to write powerful custom frameworks to be used in policies.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_592fab011d374b998d94c053e356a9ac~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_112,h_66,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_592fab011d374b998d94c053e356a9ac~mv2.jpg)\n\n**Output of the LTV framework**\n\nThe framework logic outputs the estimated discounted cash flows of the prospect which are then used to calculate the LTV of the prospect through the Valuation Function. See screenshots below.\n\n- Net Cash flow\n\n- Acquisition cost\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_b83b993b43fe4d389029cbca75bbf0ef~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_62,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_b83b993b43fe4d389029cbca75bbf0ef~mv2.jpg)\n\nThese outputs are then used to calculate the LTV and used by the policy for each prospect.\n\n### **Step 3 \u2013 Setup a policy with strategies to optimize the offer to prospect**\n\nProspecting policy setup: As the first step, register the prospecting policy through the prospecting module and set up the offer generator, the prospect LTV framework and models to be used for defining the optimization strategy. See screenshots below.\n\n**Offer generator setup**\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_160c2fe9ae384045a9ea53fbd9cb133d~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_74,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_160c2fe9ae384045a9ea53fbd9cb133d~mv2.jpg)\n\n**LTV Framework and model setup in the policy**\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_8ef218a64ceb480a8add27b8f7a5b959~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_61,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_8ef218a64ceb480a8add27b8f7a5b959~mv2.jpg)\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_bf75eb1846a241f08d21d639a62dabf9~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_51,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_bf75eb1846a241f08d21d639a62dabf9~mv2.jpg)\n\n### **Step 4- Develop a product selection offer strategy that maximizes prospect estimated value**\n\nDevelop an optimization strategy which iterates in real-time offers with varying credit limits and rates for two offered products of Installment Loan 36 months (IL\\_36) and Platinum Credit Card (PL\\_CC) and selects a product that maximizes the estimated lifetime value of prospect with a constraint of rate ceiling.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_38bd0bf9215e4a2cad6a7234f71cedee~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_44,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_38bd0bf9215e4a2cad6a7234f71cedee~mv2.jpg)\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_c835303940194c68be542546342e3873~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_37,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_c835303940194c68be542546342e3873~mv2.jpg)\n\n### **Step 5- Testing real time execution scenarios for product selection in offers**\n\nRunning various scenarios of execution of the strategy for offer generation, for a $50,000 loan, the expected lifetime value of an installment loan is higher than a platinum credit card (factoring in the response and acceptance propensities of prospect) and hence the product offered is the IL\\_36 over the PL\\_CC.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_5b2c05337d094a16932647ee2a63e140~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_65,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_5b2c05337d094a16932647ee2a63e140~mv2.jpg)\n\n### **Step 6- Offer display management when multiple offers qualify for the prospect**\n\nIn scenarios where multiple offers can be offered to the prospect, Corridor has the capability to flexibly manage rank ordering of offers that should be presented to the client. In the context of this use case, we have configured the following scenario:\n\n- If prospect FICO => 750, show them one offer that has the highest LTV of prospect across range of offer amounts\n\n- If prospect FICO < 750, show them a max offer of $40,000 loan amount across the products (IL or CC), to maximize the revenue potential and focus less on maximizing LTV.\n\n\nThe offer display logic screenshot in shown below:\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_a07346a974624b9aba20d990ecfac5e7~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_47,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_a07346a974624b9aba20d990ecfac5e7~mv2.jpg)\n\nWhile this example is an illustration, highly custom display logic (by segments as required) can be configured in the offer display module to give the ultimate \u201csegment-of-1\u201d offer customization capability to the policy writer.\n\nAs an example run, for a prospect with FICO = 720, the above display configuration results in 1 final offer being presented to the prospect at $40,000 loan amount.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_fa36e687cf074aadb9b74b34df261a5b~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_147,h_55,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_fa36e687cf074aadb9b74b34df261a5b~mv2.jpg)\n\nIn addition, the display management logic can be enhanced to factor in external competitive offers and its impact on uptake rate for the banks offer, making the offer display logic dynamic to evolving competitive and market dynamics.\n\n### **Step 7- Deployment of analytics to production quickly and continuously refinement over time**\n\nOnce the analytics is built and approved through banks\u2019 custom approval workflows on the platform, Corridor stitches together a standalone artifact which incorporates all the dependent models, features and data elements required to enable the analytics for the prospecting policy.\n\nThe artifact can then easily be called in batch or real time model flexibly by production deployment systems to enable the full use case. See schematic below for the overall process flow to stitch the artifact and extract for production deployment.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_63247e64089c4b92a854f4b87df05b3a~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_88,h_43,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_63247e64089c4b92a854f4b87df05b3a~mv2.png)\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWe have demonstrated the ease of rapidly building a sophisticated prospecting policy from scratch on Corridor, with flexibility of display management in-built into the analytics and the ability to quickly move analytics to production systems without the need to re-test or re-code and reduce the overall cycle time to market.\n\n[Bits & Banks - With Aditya Khandekar and Mike Kelly - Episode 3](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-and-mike-kelly-episode-3)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Reva Rao - Episode 2](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-reva-rao-episode-2)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Kevin Moss - Episode 1](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-kevin-moss)\n\n[Contact Us](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/contact-us)\n\n[GenGuardX](https:\/\/ggx.corridorplatforms.com\/)\n\nbottom of page\n\nWe use cookies on our website to see how you interact with it.

[RD.ai](http:\/\/rd.ai\/) by Corridor Platforms is an end-to-end decisioning platform designed to empower financial institutions with cutting-edge AI and big data technologies on a highly automated and governed analytical platform.\n\n**What opportunity or challenge does it address?**\n\nMid-market FIs face significant challenges when competing against Tier 1 FIs or aggressive fintechs for digital loan applicants. Tier 1 FIs, equipped with advanced digital capabilities and cutting-edge decisioning systems, often outperform mid-market FIs in member acquisition, marketing, and retention.\n\nWith consumers now expecting instant, seamless, and highly personalized experiences, banks and credit unions must leverage vast amounts of data on current and prospective members in real-time. However, the same data is equally accessible to competitors. This creates a critical disadvantage for mid-market FIs, which are often constrained by outdated systems, fragmented data, and limited decisioning capabilities. These limitations leave them struggling to compete effectively with Tier 1 banks and fintech disruptors already leading in personalized, data-driven decisioning.\n\nThis inability to deliver best-in-class decisioning results in subpar customer relationships, increased portfolio risk, and the potential loss of valuable members to more agile competitors. Mid-market FIs must move beyond rented point scores and instead build robust in-house capabilities that enable them to make contextually relevant, instant decisions while maintaining compliance with stringent lending laws. That is where [RD.AI](http:\/\/rd.ai\/) comes in.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\nTo meet the growing expectations of today\u2019s members, credit unions must deliver instant, personalized decisions that align with their unique needs. Corridor Platforms enables credit unions to provide real-time decision actions that offer contextually relevant solutions across the member lifecycle \u2014 whether it\u2019s acquisition, marketing, or portfolio and loss management.\n\nBy automating decisioning with over 85% efficiency, credit unions can offer seamless, personalized experiences with speed while maintaining compliance. This empowers credit unions to provide faster approvals, point-of-sale financing, real-time credit limit adjustments, etc., while also proactively managing and monitoring risks. With this solution, members experience a more responsive, member-centric approach to their financial needs.\n\n**What differentiates this innovation from competitors?**\n\n[RiskDecisoning.AI](http:\/\/riskdecisoning.ai\/) is a full-stack decisioning platform that extends beyond scoring to deliver end-to-end decision actions. Key differentiators include:\n\n- **End-to-End Decisioning**: [RD.AI](http:\/\/rd.ai\/) enables AI-driven decision actions across the entire portfolio: consumer and commercial lending, including dynamic pricing and contextual offers, driving higher applicant uptake and deposit product pricing. It optimizes the entire member lifecycle\u2014acquisition, portfolio management, marketing, and loss management to maximize long-term customer value.\n\n- **Integration Flexibility**: [RD.AI](http:\/\/rd.ai\/) seamlessly integrates with bureau scores (e.g., Transunion, [Zest.ai](http:\/\/zest.ai\/), Scienaptic) while offering proprietary & in-house decisioning capabilities.\n\n- **Post-Production Monitoring & Refinement**: Automated dashboards to track performance and trigger alerts if models underperform \u2014 creating a continuous improvement loop.\n\n- **Whitebox Transparency**: Unlike black box score providers, [RD.AI](http:\/\/rd.ai\/) grants CUs full access to decision logic, enabling internal capability building and ensuring compliance without vendor dependency.\n\n\nFull Link [Below](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/features\/perspectives\/meet-the-finalists-for-the-2025-innovation-series-analytics\/#Corridor%20Platforms):\n\nMeet The 2025 Innovation Series Finalists: Analytics\n\n[Skip to content](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/features\/perspectives\/meet-the-finalists-for-the-2025-innovation-series-analytics\/#content \"Skip to content\")\n\n[![](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/CreditUnions_logo.svg)](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/)\n\nMain Menu\n\nSearch\n\nSponsored Content\n\n# Meet The Finalists For The 2025 Innovation Series: Analytics\n\nThis year's finalists help credit unions do more with data to grow their business and increase efficiency.\n\n[Sponsored Content By Callahan & Associates, Inc.](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/blog-posts\/?acc=0016000000EhUtWAAV)\n\n[![](https:\/\/portal.callahan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/10\/callahan_logo_2023.png)](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/directory\/account-view\/?account=342601)\n\nThink of it as Shark Tank with a credit union spin, and it\u2019s just been renewed for another season.\n\nThe 2025 Innovation Series from CreditUnions.com and Callahan & Associates is underway.

This reliance on paper means higher fraud levels, a poor member experience, lots of manual work for lending opps teams, and too many lost loans and deposits. Conductiv digitizes document collection and provides AI to find patterns in lending. The platform reduces fraud, improves the member experience, saves hundreds of hours a month in manual work, and increases approval\/account opening rates by up to 47%.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\n- Paper paystubs\/documents or branch visits are no longer required to get approved\/open an account.\n- Fraud and time to loan is dramatically reduced, and more loans and accounts can be made\/opened without increasing risk.\n\n**What differentiates this innovation from competitors?**\n\n- Conductiv is pre-integrated with many POS and LOS systems providing turnkey access for 3k+ lenders.\n- The platform can be implemented in just 4 hours with no IT resources needed.\n- Our AI finds patterns to improve lending and also works with existing alternative credit score providers.\n- The platform never stores member PII minimizing risk.\n\n## Corridor Platforms\n\n![Aditya Khandekar, Chief Revenue Officer, Corridor Platforms](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Aditya-Khandekar-Corridor_resized.jpg)Aditya Khandekar, Chief Revenue Officer, Corridor Platforms\n\n**Describe your innovation.**\n\nBuilt by a team of seasoned risk professionals, RiskDecisioning.AI (RD.ai) addresses the critical need for speed, innovation, and governance in financial decision-making, transforming how FIs experiment, deploy, and iterate on analytics in today\u2019s fast-paced digital era.

EDGE\u2019s direct-to-core integrations provide 360-views of member financial health, via summarized and\/or AI-driven insights, such as income verification (and the ability to repay), total debt payments (including BNPL), cashflow-driven credit scores for those with thin or no credit files. Because of the direct-to-core integration, credit unions can get these member insights without drop-offs that could happen with IBV. Our platform also delivers data \u201coff us\u201d insights for members and non-members with accounts at another financial institution giving credit unions a full 360-view of their members regardless of where they bank. This opens the door for credit unions by allowing them to offer their members competitive products, in a streamlined and automated fashion like most large banks and fintechs can do today.\n\n**What opportunity or challenge does it address?**\n\nLoan officers and underwriters at the credit union can now see real-time cashflow insights including members\u2019 income, spending and balance behaviors, without the need for the member to credential, a frictionless member experience.\n\nThrough EDGE\u2019s open banking network, Trius also now sees data and insights from external financial accounts. Members and non-members alike can provide consent and share their external accounts with Trius in seconds just like they would normally log in to another account.\n\nAfter implementing EDGE for 100% of applications, Trius successfully verified income for over 80% of members with a primary account at the credit union and over 6% of all applications. This enormous benefit was available with zero added friction for members. As a result, Trius eliminated a great majority of income stipulations and measurably improved look to book rates.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\nCredit unions can now provide more personalized care with at-a-glance financial insights. Members will likely have better access to credit or optimized offers, as cashflow analytics fills in blind spots in FICO scores and other traditional credit bureau data.\n\n**What differentiates this innovation from competitors?**\n\nEDGE was the first cashflow consumer reporting agency and the only agency with direct-to-core insights for cashflow data. Unlike competitors, we offer summaries of data and machine-generated insights, instead of raw or lists of transaction data.\n\n## Powerlytics\n\n![Kevin Sheetz, CEO, Powerlytics](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Kevin-Sheetz-Powerlytics_resized.jpg)Kevin Sheetz, CEO, Powerlytics\n\n**Describe your innovation.**\n\nPowerlytics is a proprietary data platform providing access to the complete financial pictures of all households and businesses across the U.S. With over 20 years of developing powerful IP, including consulting with the federal government, Powerlytics now enables credit unions to streamline underwriting through frictionless income verification and estimation, optimize marketing through accurate estimates of household deposits and business revenue, and empower smarter risk-management and targeting through machine learning performance models.\n\n**What opportunity or challenge does it address?**\n\nPowerlytics\u2019 income estimates and confidence scores, underpinned by anonymized IRS tax return data, eliminate the tedious income verification process and accelerate underwriting to meet both the rising expectations of modern consumers and the ever-increasing competition from fintechs. By incorporating investable asset data into deposit growth strategies, credit unions can identify new members with the highest deposit potential while simultaneously capturing greater wallet share with current members. Additionally, data analytics can be leveraged to improve marketing ROI and create operational efficiencies through custom propensity models that identify members most likely to engage with specific products or cure delinquent accounts. Powerlytics\u2019 team of Ph.D. data scientists simplify these complex analytical processes to ensure credit unions can focus on delivering member-centric solutions and building relationships.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\nPowerlytics\u2019 Source of Truth data allows credit unions to analyze income and wealth trends, as well as savings patterns, to identify underserved member segments and provide tailored solutions that enable broader financial participation. Incorporating these insights into generational personas, particularly focusing on wealth transfer opportunities, allows credit unions to create offerings resonating with younger and older members alike while proactively engaging the next generation of market share. Powerlytics\u2019 thousands of consumer financial data variables empower credit unions to create a simplified member experience that leads to fewer loan applicant drop-offs, reducing adverse selection and approving more high-quality loans. Additionally, this data can be used to extend proactive credit line increases that meet member needs while balancing risk.\n\n**What differentiates this innovation from competitors?**\n\nPowerlytics is the only data CUSO providing zero-friction income verification and investable asset solutions to cover 100% of U.S. households and businesses. Our permissionless platform and proprietary IP empowers credit unions with Source of Truth insights, unlike less-accurate modeled solutions, to drive wallet share and enable risk decisioning through data.

This reliance on paper means higher fraud levels, a poor member experience, lots of manual work for lending opps teams, and too many lost loans and deposits. Conductiv digitizes document collection and provides AI to find patterns in lending. The platform reduces fraud, improves the member experience, saves hundreds of hours a month in manual work, and increases approval\/account opening rates by up to 47%.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\n- Paper paystubs\/documents or branch visits are no longer required to get approved\/open an account.\n- Fraud and time to loan is dramatically reduced, and more loans and accounts can be made\/opened without increasing risk.\n\n**What differentiates this innovation from competitors?**\n\n- Conductiv is pre-integrated with many POS and LOS systems providing turnkey access for 3k+ lenders.\n- The platform can be implemented in just 4 hours with no IT resources needed.\n- Our AI finds patterns to improve lending and also works with existing alternative credit score providers.\n- The platform never stores member PII minimizing risk.\n\n## Corridor Platforms\n\n![Aditya Khandekar, Chief Revenue Officer, Corridor Platforms](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Aditya-Khandekar-Corridor_resized.jpg)Aditya Khandekar, Chief Revenue Officer, Corridor Platforms\n\n**Describe your innovation.**\n\nBuilt by a team of seasoned risk professionals, RiskDecisioning.AI (RD.ai) addresses the critical need for speed, innovation, and governance in financial decision-making, transforming how FIs experiment, deploy, and iterate on analytics in today\u2019s fast-paced digital era.

EDGE\u2019s direct-to-core integrations provide 360-views of member financial health, via summarized and\/or AI-driven insights, such as income verification (and the ability to repay), total debt payments (including BNPL), cashflow-driven credit scores for those with thin or no credit files. Because of the direct-to-core integration, credit unions can get these member insights without drop-offs that could happen with IBV. Our platform also delivers data \u201coff us\u201d insights for members and non-members with accounts at another financial institution giving credit unions a full 360-view of their members regardless of where they bank. This opens the door for credit unions by allowing them to offer their members competitive products, in a streamlined and automated fashion like most large banks and fintechs can do today.\n\n**What opportunity or challenge does it address?**\n\nLoan officers and underwriters at the credit union can now see real-time cashflow insights including members\u2019 income, spending and balance behaviors, without the need for the member to credential, a frictionless member experience.\n\nThrough EDGE\u2019s open banking network, Trius also now sees data and insights from external financial accounts. Members and non-members alike can provide consent and share their external accounts with Trius in seconds just like they would normally log in to another account.\n\nAfter implementing EDGE for 100% of applications, Trius successfully verified income for over 80% of members with a primary account at the credit union and over 6% of all applications. This enormous benefit was available with zero added friction for members. As a result, Trius eliminated a great majority of income stipulations and measurably improved look to book rates.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\nCredit unions can now provide more personalized care with at-a-glance financial insights. Members will likely have better access to credit or optimized offers, as cashflow analytics fills in blind spots in FICO scores and other traditional credit bureau data.\n\n**What differentiates this innovation from competitors?**\n\nEDGE was the first cashflow consumer reporting agency and the only agency with direct-to-core insights for cashflow data. Unlike competitors, we offer summaries of data and machine-generated insights, instead of raw or lists of transaction data.\n\n## Powerlytics\n\n![Kevin Sheetz, CEO, Powerlytics](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Kevin-Sheetz-Powerlytics_resized.jpg)Kevin Sheetz, CEO, Powerlytics\n\n**Describe your innovation.**\n\nPowerlytics is a proprietary data platform providing access to the complete financial pictures of all households and businesses across the U.S. With over 20 years of developing powerful IP, including consulting with the federal government, Powerlytics now enables credit unions to streamline underwriting through frictionless income verification and estimation, optimize marketing through accurate estimates of household deposits and business revenue, and empower smarter risk-management and targeting through machine learning performance models.\n\n**What opportunity or challenge does it address?**\n\nPowerlytics\u2019 income estimates and confidence scores, underpinned by anonymized IRS tax return data, eliminate the tedious income verification process and accelerate underwriting to meet both the rising expectations of modern consumers and the ever-increasing competition from fintechs. By incorporating investable asset data into deposit growth strategies, credit unions can identify new members with the highest deposit potential while simultaneously capturing greater wallet share with current members. Additionally, data analytics can be leveraged to improve marketing ROI and create operational efficiencies through custom propensity models that identify members most likely to engage with specific products or cure delinquent accounts. Powerlytics\u2019 team of Ph.D. data scientists simplify these complex analytical processes to ensure credit unions can focus on delivering member-centric solutions and building relationships.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\nPowerlytics\u2019 Source of Truth data allows credit unions to analyze income and wealth trends, as well as savings patterns, to identify underserved member segments and provide tailored solutions that enable broader financial participation. Incorporating these insights into generational personas, particularly focusing on wealth transfer opportunities, allows credit unions to create offerings resonating with younger and older members alike while proactively engaging the next generation of market share. Powerlytics\u2019 thousands of consumer financial data variables empower credit unions to create a simplified member experience that leads to fewer loan applicant drop-offs, reducing adverse selection and approving more high-quality loans. Additionally, this data can be used to extend proactive credit line increases that meet member needs while balancing risk.\n\n**What differentiates this innovation from competitors?**\n\nPowerlytics is the only data CUSO providing zero-friction income verification and investable asset solutions to cover 100% of U.S. households and businesses. Our permissionless platform and proprietary IP empowers credit unions with Source of Truth insights, unlike less-accurate modeled solutions, to drive wallet share and enable risk decisioning through data.

That is where [RD.AI](http:\/\/rd.ai\/) comes in.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\nTo meet the growing expectations of today\u2019s members, credit unions must deliver instant, personalized decisions that align with their unique needs. Corridor Platforms enables credit unions to provide real-time decision actions that offer contextually relevant solutions across the member lifecycle \u2014 whether it\u2019s acquisition, marketing, or portfolio and loss management.\n\nBy automating decisioning with over 85% efficiency, credit unions can offer seamless, personalized experiences with speed while maintaining compliance. This empowers credit unions to provide faster approvals, point-of-sale financing, real-time credit limit adjustments, etc., while also proactively managing and monitoring risks. With this solution, members experience a more responsive, member-centric approach to their financial needs.\n\n**What differentiates this innovation from competitors?**\n\n[RiskDecisoning.AI](http:\/\/riskdecisoning.ai\/) is a full-stack decisioning platform that extends beyond scoring to deliver end-to-end decision actions.

This reliance on paper means higher fraud levels, a poor member experience, lots of manual work for lending opps teams, and too many lost loans and deposits. Conductiv digitizes document collection and provides AI to find patterns in lending. The platform reduces fraud, improves the member experience, saves hundreds of hours a month in manual work, and increases approval\/account opening rates by up to 47%.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\n- Paper paystubs\/documents or branch visits are no longer required to get approved\/open an account.\n- Fraud and time to loan is dramatically reduced, and more loans and accounts can be made\/opened without increasing risk.\n\n**What differentiates this innovation from competitors?**\n\n- Conductiv is pre-integrated with many POS and LOS systems providing turnkey access for 3k+ lenders.\n- The platform can be implemented in just 4 hours with no IT resources needed.\n- Our AI finds patterns to improve lending and also works with existing alternative credit score providers.\n- The platform never stores member PII minimizing risk.\n\n## Corridor Platforms\n\n![Aditya Khandekar, Chief Revenue Officer, Corridor Platforms](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Aditya-Khandekar-Corridor_resized.jpg)Aditya Khandekar, Chief Revenue Officer, Corridor Platforms\n\n**Describe your innovation.**\n\nBuilt by a team of seasoned risk professionals, RiskDecisioning.AI (RD.ai) addresses the critical need for speed, innovation, and governance in financial decision-making, transforming how FIs experiment, deploy, and iterate on analytics in today\u2019s fast-paced digital era. RD.ai by Corridor Platforms is an end-to-end decisioning platform designed to empower financial institutions with cutting-edge AI and big data technologies on a highly automated and governed analytical platform.\n\n**What opportunity or challenge does it address?**\n\nMid-market FIs face significant challenges when competing against Tier 1 FIs or aggressive fintechs for digital loan applicants. Tier 1 FIs, equipped with advanced digital capabilities and cutting-edge decisioning systems, often outperform mid-market FIs in member acquisition, marketing, and retention.\n\nWith consumers now expecting instant, seamless, and highly personalized experiences, banks and credit unions must leverage vast amounts of data on current and prospective members in real-time. However, the same data is equally accessible to competitors. This creates a critical disadvantage for mid-market FIs, which are often constrained by outdated systems, fragmented data, and limited decisioning capabilities. These limitations leave them struggling to compete effectively with Tier 1 banks and fintech disruptors already leading in personalized, data-driven decisioning.\n\nThis inability to deliver best-in-class decisioning results in subpar customer relationships, increased portfolio risk, and the potential loss of valuable members to more agile competitors. Mid-market FIs must move beyond rented point scores and instead build robust in-house capabilities that enable them to make contextually relevant, instant decisions while maintaining compliance with stringent lending laws. That is where RD.AI comes in.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\nTo meet the growing expectations of today\u2019s members, credit unions must deliver instant, personalized decisions that align with their unique needs. Corridor Platforms enables credit unions to provide real-time decision actions that offer contextually relevant solutions across the member lifecycle \u2014 whether it\u2019s acquisition, marketing, or portfolio and loss management.\n\nBy automating decisioning with over 85% efficiency, credit unions can offer seamless, personalized experiences with speed while maintaining compliance.

EDGE\u2019s direct-to-core integrations provide 360-views of member financial health, via summarized and\/or AI-driven insights, such as income verification (and the ability to repay), total debt payments (including BNPL), cashflow-driven credit scores for those with thin or no credit files. Because of the direct-to-core integration, credit unions can get these member insights without drop-offs that could happen with IBV. Our platform also delivers data \u201coff us\u201d insights for members and non-members with accounts at another financial institution giving credit unions a full 360-view of their members regardless of where they bank. This opens the door for credit unions by allowing them to offer their members competitive products, in a streamlined and automated fashion like most large banks and fintechs can do today.\n\n**What opportunity or challenge does it address?**\n\nLoan officers and underwriters at the credit union can now see real-time cashflow insights including members\u2019 income, spending and balance behaviors, without the need for the member to credential, a frictionless member experience.\n\nThrough EDGE\u2019s open banking network, Trius also now sees data and insights from external financial accounts. Members and non-members alike can provide consent and share their external accounts with Trius in seconds just like they would normally log in to another account.\n\nAfter implementing EDGE for 100% of applications, Trius successfully verified income for over 80% of members with a primary account at the credit union and over 6% of all applications. This enormous benefit was available with zero added friction for members. As a result, Trius eliminated a great majority of income stipulations and measurably improved look to book rates.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\nCredit unions can now provide more personalized care with at-a-glance financial insights. Members will likely have better access to credit or optimized offers, as cashflow analytics fills in blind spots in FICO scores and other traditional credit bureau data.\n\n**What differentiates this innovation from competitors?**\n\nEDGE was the first cashflow consumer reporting agency and the only agency with direct-to-core insights for cashflow data. Unlike competitors, we offer summaries of data and machine-generated insights, instead of raw or lists of transaction data.\n\n## Powerlytics\n\n![Kevin Sheetz, CEO, Powerlytics](https:\/\/creditunions.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Kevin-Sheetz-Powerlytics_resized.jpg)Kevin Sheetz, CEO, Powerlytics\n\n**Describe your innovation.**\n\nPowerlytics is a proprietary data platform providing access to the complete financial pictures of all households and businesses across the U.S. With over 20 years of developing powerful IP, including consulting with the federal government, Powerlytics now enables credit unions to streamline underwriting through frictionless income verification and estimation, optimize marketing through accurate estimates of household deposits and business revenue, and empower smarter risk-management and targeting through machine learning performance models.\n\n**What opportunity or challenge does it address?**\n\nPowerlytics\u2019 income estimates and confidence scores, underpinned by anonymized IRS tax return data, eliminate the tedious income verification process and accelerate underwriting to meet both the rising expectations of modern consumers and the ever-increasing competition from fintechs. By incorporating investable asset data into deposit growth strategies, credit unions can identify new members with the highest deposit potential while simultaneously capturing greater wallet share with current members. Additionally, data analytics can be leveraged to improve marketing ROI and create operational efficiencies through custom propensity models that identify members most likely to engage with specific products or cure delinquent accounts. Powerlytics\u2019 team of Ph.D. data scientists simplify these complex analytical processes to ensure credit unions can focus on delivering member-centric solutions and building relationships.\n\n**How does it increase member value?**\n\nPowerlytics\u2019 Source of Truth data allows credit unions to analyze income and wealth trends, as well as savings patterns, to identify underserved member segments and provide tailored solutions that enable broader financial participation. Incorporating these insights into generational personas, particularly focusing on wealth transfer opportunities, allows credit unions to create offerings resonating with younger and older members alike while proactively engaging the next generation of market share. Powerlytics\u2019 thousands of consumer financial data variables empower credit unions to create a simplified member experience that leads to fewer loan applicant drop-offs, reducing adverse selection and approving more high-quality loans. Additionally, this data can be used to extend proactive credit line increases that meet member needs while balancing risk.\n\n**What differentiates this innovation from competitors?**\n\nPowerlytics is the only data CUSO providing zero-friction income verification and investable asset solutions to cover 100% of U.S. households and businesses. Our permissionless platform and proprietary IP empowers credit unions with Source of Truth insights, unlike less-accurate modeled solutions, to drive wallet share and enable risk decisioning through data. Powerlytics data does not rely on client contributions or member opt-ins that result in incomplete coverage like consortium or survey-based models and requires no exchange of PII.\n\nThis article is sponsored by a recognized solutions provider in the credit union industry.

It offers an interface that enables users to access snapshots and trend statistics related to various objects, jobs, and users. The dashboard provides various metadata information such as properties, attributes, and statuses of the registered objects.\n\nMonitoring Dashboard is an indispensable tool for review committees and project managers, offering a rich set of features to monitor, analyze, and review all elements registered on the platform efficiently.\n\nThe \"Monitoring Dashboard\" is accessible in the \"GenAI Studio\" the sub-menu of all modules and is available at various levels (Pipelines, Models, Prompts, RAGs) - and can be used to\n\n### Base Views [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/deploy-and-monitor\/oversight\/\\#base-views \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis is the default view that the organization decides to show to all users of the platform. Typically the primary cockpit is to quickly find the overall status of governance across all objects on the Platform.\n\nBy default, the baseview contains examples of monitoring reports that can help better understand governance activities. They can be adopted or swapped with custom views that better fit the organization's interest.\n\n- **Approval Status View**: It presents an overview of the approval status of different objects grouped under their respective Object Groups.\n\n- **Review History View**: The columns show the distribution of reviews based on their history, with time intervals.\n\n- **Last Review Status View**: It focuses on the most recent review status of objects, organized by Object Groups. The columns display different review statuses, including Accepted with Flag, Accepted without Flag, Pending Acceptance, and Rejected.\n\n- **Schedule Review Status View**: The \"Schedule Review Status View\" offers insights into the scheduled review periods for objects within Object Groups.\n\n\nExplore these pre-configured views and customize them further to cater to specific monitoring needs and gain deeper insights into the platform's governance.\n\n### Data View [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/deploy-and-monitor\/oversight\/\\#data-view \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis view presents the complete data for the selected object type in a tabular format. Users can easily navigate to specific objects by clicking on the rows. Additionally, they can apply filters or sort rows based on any specified column.\n\nThe data view is a comprehensive place to access all information across the entire platform - and is the base for nearly all other types of monitoring - be it creating Custom Views or creating automated Alerts.\n\n### Automated Alerts [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/deploy-and-monitor\/oversight\/\\#automated-alerts \"Permanent link\")\n\nAlerts are defined as a set of rules that are designed to identify specific items or events that require immediate attention or further action. These rules are created based on predefined criteria, enabling the system to detect critical situations, anomalies, or deviations from expected behaviour. When the conditions specified in the alert rules are met, the system triggers events such as notifications, emails etc. Ensuring that appropriate actions can be taken promptly to address the identified issues.\n\n### Creating Alerts [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/deploy-and-monitor\/oversight\/\\#creating-alerts \"Permanent link\")\n\nOn the platform, users have the flexibility to create custom alerts tailored to their specific needs.

[\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/register-and-refine\/inventory-management\/rags\/\\#what-is-a-rag \"Permanent link\")\n\n**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI approach that helps language models by integrating a retrieval mechanism that fetches relevant external information in real-time.

The breakthrough new solution leverages advanced analytics, AI and the cloud to deliver instant credit decisions necessary to support digital lending initiatives such as point-of-sale financing, digital loans, mortgage approvals and real-time credit limit changes.\n\nThe rapid-fire growth of digital lending has put mid-sized and regional banks at a significant disadvantage versus national players with the tech infrastructure in place to support real-time decisioning. With this new decisioning-as-a-service solution, banks and credit unions of every type will now be able to take advantage of a hosted advanced decisioning cloud populated with external and internal data sources and a dedicated team of industry experts, while maintaining full control of compliance and governance. This will enable them to become competitive immediately versus the most advanced lenders.\u201cAs digital lending products have proliferated, the customer expectation for instant approval on everything from a buy now, pay later offer to an online mortgage application has put enormous pressure on lenders to automate their credit risk decisioning processes,\u201d said Ash Gupta, Chairman of Corridor Platforms and former Chief Risk Officer of American Express.\n\n> \u201cWhile speed is clearly the goal, it cannot come at the expense of robust risk controls. With our risk decisioning as a service solution, we\u2019re giving lenders a turnkey solution to deliver real-time credit decisions with the risk governance necessary to meet their fiduciary requirements.\u201d\n\nSmaller banks have found it prohibitively expensive to invest in big data technologies and attract top AI\/ML talent to complete effectively. Some banks have started using generic vendor scores for decisioning, but as most products become digital, this strategy could leave them at a permanent competitive disadvantage versus real-time, hyper-personalized models and decisioning strategies. Decisioning is a core function and banks need to make a transformational leap to meet growing digital expectations from consumers. While most solution providers use black box models, this industry first offering is truly a build, operate, transfer solution. It will allow banks to learn on the job from industry experts, as they modernize\/automate the decisioning process, with immediate performance gains as a proof point.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to lending, current consumer expectations are that they get to choose between relevant offers from multiple sources and receive real-time answers. Regional banks and Credit Unions, used to a loyal and captive base, are dealing with acceptance rates that have fallen sharply in recent months. To be relevant, banks need to transform their data\/analytics infrastructure and uplift modeling talent quickly,\u201d said Vikram Pandit, Chairman of EXL and former Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup. \u201cWith this new offering, we\u2019re bringing the collective power of the industry\u2019s leading technology, analytics and governance experts together to create a solution that will make lenders competitive quickly, while transferring critical know-how so that they become self-dependent in the long run.\u201d\n\nCapturing a wide range of traditional credit risk measures, including credit scores, purchase and payment histories and bank statement data, along with non-traditional data, real-time fraud screening and risk rating tools based on data generated from each new transaction, the risk decisioning-as-a-service solution is designed to address the unique challenges of digital lending.\n\n\u201cLenders offering real-time digital credit products need to get comfortable moving beyond traditional credit data and scoring by adopting AI-enabled software that learns from all relevant data and builds proprietary risk scoring in real-time. But they need to do so with full compliance and robust governance,\u201d said Til Schuermann, Co-Head of Oliver Wyman\u2019s Finance, Risk and Public Policy practice and Board member of Corridor Platforms. \u201cOliver Wyman is thrilled to collaborate with Corridor and EXL to provide analytics, risk management and regulatory expertise and guidance as they stand up this industry first offering.\u201d\n\nBoth EXL and Oliver Wyman have a long history of working together with Corridor to support client needs and both companies have a minority stake in Corridor.For more information about this Risk Decisioning-as-a-Service solution, click [www.exlservice.com\/credit-risk-decisioning](https:\/\/www.exlservice.com\/services-and-solutions\/digital-and-ai\/real-time-credit-risk-decisioning).\u00a9 2022 ExlService Holdings, Inc.

The Change History is a collection of **snapshots**:\n\n- The platform takes a snapshot of an object every time the object is edited and saved\n- A snapshot is an exact copy of an object at the time of saving\n- A change can be reverted back by restoring the **snapshot** at that point in time\n- Snapshots can be Named and previewed or even restored as a copy\n\n[![Change History Page](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/register-and-refine\/version-management\/change-history.png)](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/register-and-refine\/version-management\/change-history.png)\n\n### Version Tracking for Approved items [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/register-and-refine\/version-management\/\\#version-tracking-for-approved-items \"Permanent link\")\n\nOnce a Draft is approved - it can not be modified. But by creating a **clone** (i.e. a new version) new changes can be made to continue working on that item. The new version will be a copy of the object being cloned with the same Name, Alias, and Type.\n\nOnly the latest approved version of an object can be cloned.\n\nBy design, all previous uses of the older version of the object will keep using the previous versions - and not be updated to the new version unless it is explicitly updated to use the newer version. This is different compared to changes made to a Draft, as changes in a Draft are immediately propagated downstream.\n\nWas this page helpful?","36","https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/register-and-refine\/version-management\/","Version Management - Corridor GGX Documentation","Core Product : GenGuardX","Evaluation #1","What is a key benefit of maintaining a comprehensive change history?","Maintaining a comprehensive change history is important for several reasons: it enhances traceability, improves accountability, facilitates debugging, ensures compliance with regulations, and builds trust by providing transparency into model evolution.","1.0","The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the output is perfectly faithful to the retrieval context!

We highlight key challenges to the model management process in the current Covid-19 driven crisis and how CP can address some of those challenges.\n\n### **Model Management in Banking**\n\nModel Management is a closed-loop process involving model development\/calibration, model validation, deployment & model monitoring. The overall process requires close coordination among the model development, validation, production and monitoring teams at the bank with robust controls & well-defined interfaces between teams. Speed-to-market and strong governance are critical for banks to compete nimbly and flexibly in the marketplace.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_7666f719b55d45cdbbfda9f029300466~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_634,h_594,al_c,q_90,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_7666f719b55d45cdbbfda9f029300466~mv2.png)\n\nAs an introduction, The Corridor team is mostly banking industry experts who have learned their skill underwriting and managing multi-billion dollar loan books through multiple recessionary cycles. We have taken our experience as end-users and incorporated our learnings in developing an integrated [decision management](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/principle) [workflow automation](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/) platform to help banks\/regulated firms leapfrog legacy decisioning processes and technologies to a next gen capability\/platform needed to win in the age of digitization.\n\n### **Model Development**\n\n- **Authorized access to new data sources with controls**: CP\u2019s highly connected platforms allow rapid incorporation of new data sources with the right level of controls for authorized use, while providing complete flexibility for modelers to leverage AI for innovation in risk modeling while enhancing governance and traceability. In the example below, the account level forbearance data from the bureau is registered and governed for permissible use in models for underwriting with full lineage traceability of use in downstream models.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_33f6fd8db13d4b8cbeb2c486def86bda~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_740,h_327,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_33f6fd8db13d4b8cbeb2c486def86bda~mv2.png)\n\n- **Integrate CP governed & connected data into the full cycle model development process:**\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_f71caa8057f24c44b17ecfb50befe4ab~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_29,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_f71caa8057f24c44b17ecfb50befe4ab~mv2.png)\n\nCP offers a rich library of routines that allow modelers to extract authorized data from CP to their modeling sandboxes though python and then have complete flexibility to use powerful ML\/AI libraries like Anaconda, H2O, PyTorch to build robust models leveraging big data.\n\n- **Rapidly develop and test new decision strategies using \u2018English like\u2019 rule writer**: CP also supports rapid development of strategy overlay rules on model output using a strategy writer engine that is highly intuitive and easy for a policy writer to use. Strategy rules can be defined segment-wise or encompass all segments. In the example below, the score cutoff for default for high affected states by Covid-19 is tightened versus BAU, with an intuitive rule overlay on existing model scores.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_f32dae2e27c84ad29b4f946b34239f99~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_22,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_f32dae2e27c84ad29b4f946b34239f99~mv2.png)\n\n### Model Validation\n\n- **Highly configurable model validation module with workflow automation to support efficient interaction:**\n\n  - CP\u2019s model validation module comes in two variants,\n\n    - Model Validation \u2013 Single model, multiple validation datasets\n\n    - Model Comparison \u2013 Multiple models, single validation datasets (ex: champion challenger scenarios)\n\nThe platform enables the model developer and reviewer to rapidly develop multiple scenarios for model validation (including extensive data segmentation), automate the development of standardized model performance metrics (ex: AUC curve, KS Tables etc.) and track the approval workflow process including multiple approval levels & audit trails through the platform. In the example below, the segmented validation for low FICO applicant base is lower than the benchmark and suggests that the modeler might need to put in some business rule overlays to address the issue. In addition, the following image shows the approval workflows audit engine which supports layered approvals with audit trails.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_c9fd2308cf2b4d33904cb01c533d32de~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_21,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_c9fd2308cf2b4d33904cb01c533d32de~mv2.png)\n\n### **Moving Models from analytics to production & feedback loop**\n\n- **Decision artifact generation**: CP automatically stitches together a standalone artifact that can be deployed seamlessly in the bank\u2019s production systems. The artifact can score in batch (on Spark cluster) or real-time mode (on python) and exactly mirrors the logic developed during the analytic build process.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_ae2dc053646d41edad4de99b701cf1da~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_20,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_ae2dc053646d41edad4de99b701cf1da~mv2.png)\n\n- **Enable rapid test-learn**: CP offers automated workflows to measure impact of decisions based on models by allowing new performance data to be easily loaded and used for the measurement metrics which are standardized across model or product families.\n\n\n### **Model Performance Monitoring**\n\n- **Automated model monitoring** **:** CP provides capabilities for banks to easily set up automated performance monitoring of models at pre-scheduled periods as well as define performance benchmark thresholds, which if breached, resulting in an exception trigger report to the model monitoring team. This automates the monitoring process and facilitates management by exception. In the example below 16 iterations for model tracking on a weekly basis is setup with floor and ceiling AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.55 & 0.85 respectively.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_7ab06dd78a6e48f9989a8104e5472061~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_65,h_40,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_7ab06dd78a6e48f9989a8104e5472061~mv2.png)\n\n- **Segmental performance monitoring**: CP allows the bank to easily setup and measure the segmental performance of BAU models to identify potential model \u2018breaks\u2019. In the example below, the model performance is unstable for the severe Covid-19 affected segment of customers by region (COVID severity cutoffs are based on COVID index defined at regional level).\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_6cec33406e4340b3b05a9d3d1ffcc8f3~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_23,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_6cec33406e4340b3b05a9d3d1ffcc8f3~mv2.png)\n\n### **Ramifications of multiple waves of Covid-19 for Banks\u2019 models**\n\nWe are going through an unprecedented period of uncertainty based on multiple waves of the Covid-19 driven crisis and its economic impact on business sectors, geographic regions and customer behavior. From the chart below, it\u2019s clear that multiple waves of Covid-19 driven crisis will result in uneven impact on different sectors and shape customer behavior in unique new ways.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_ee47bff211974500a4ae8680c4132d61~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_46,h_20,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_ee47bff211974500a4ae8680c4132d61~mv2.png)\n\n_Source: Oliver Wyman insights_\n\nThe Fed recently carried out a sensitivity analysis to assess the threat to banking resulting from the adverse effects of the pandemic. Though all participating banks look sufficiently capitalized for now, 25% of them could report CET1 capital ratio close to the regulatory minimum of 4.5% if the economy witnessed a W shaped recovery trajectory in upcoming quarters. This can be further compounded by Covid-19 waves.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_f2ca4b74084743c4bff2bf8e7829a1c3~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_20,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_f2ca4b74084743c4bff2bf8e7829a1c3~mv2.png)\n\n_Source:_ [_Assessment of Bank Capital during the Recent Coronavirus Event, June 2020_](https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/publications\/files\/2020-sensitivity-analysis-20200625.pdf)\n\nAn obvious implication of the pandemic on banks\u2019 models is that population characteristics have now changed in ways which were unimaginable for most experts at the time those models were built. Sectors like food services and air transport are expected to be impacted quite adversely across crisis scenarios based on analysis done by Oliver Wyman in its recently published report on [model management](https:\/\/www.oliverwyman.com\/our-expertise\/events\/2020\/jun\/covid-19-impact-on-the-us-financial-system-ccar-results-model-management.html#Overview) (see an excerpt on industry analysis from the report below).\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_afddb11823324a2882518079d615d1d4~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_30,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_afddb11823324a2882518079d615d1d4~mv2.png)\n\n_Source: Oliver Wyman \u2013_ [_COVID-19 and Impact on the U_](https:\/\/www.mmc.com\/content\/dam\/mmc-web\/insights\/publications\/2020\/july\/Oliver-Wyman-Webinar-COVID-19-CCAR-and-MRM.pdf) [_S_](https:\/\/www.mmc.com\/content\/dam\/mmc-web\/insights\/publications\/2020\/july\/Oliver-Wyman-Webinar-COVID-19-CCAR-and-MRM.pdf) [_Financial System July 2020_](https:\/\/www.mmc.com\/content\/dam\/mmc-web\/insights\/publications\/2020\/july\/Oliver-Wyman-Webinar-COVID-19-CCAR-and-MRM.pdf)\n\n### **Strategic challenges for model management in retail credit and potential solutions leveraging Corridor\u2019s decision management suite**\n\n##### **Pain points in Model development**\n\n- **Relationships between predictors and outcome broken in crisis period**: Due to the extreme and uncharted impact of Covid-19, traditional model relationships might break. For example, relationships between macroeconomic variables and default due to large scale deferrals. Banks have options for:\n\n  - **_Retrain models using new data safely_**: Banks need the ability to bring in new data (ex: Bureau forbearances at loan level) with robust control & governance and safely incorporate that data for model retraining with right permissible use.\n\n  - **_Build business overlay strategies for short term model fixes_**: Banks also need the ability to quickly update their decisions strategies (or business overlays) based on models. Due to lack of historical data or precedence in a highly uncertain environment, banks need the ability to use expert judgment and assumptions driven decision strategies instead of model retraining.\n- **Flexibility in model development required due to lack of specific guidance in the pandemic period**: Banks need the flexibility to develop multiple training datasets with exclusion\/inclusion criteria's and segmental dataset which are approved for use by 1st\/2nd line of defence teams and have strict governance protocols for model build and scenarios planning.\n\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**\n\nCorridor\u2019s fully integrated solution facilitates necessary adjustments and recalibration of impacted ML models. \u2018English like\u2019 rule writer helps enhance models with expert judgement based overlays quickly (ex: stricter underwriting rules for worst-affected customer segments) that are essential in an uncertain crisis period with limited data availability for robust recalibration. Strong focus on governance & connectivity between model and strategies ensures that all there are no compliance violations (ex: fair lending requirements). The updated models and\/or strategies can be quickly extracted as artifacts for production scoring.\n\n##### **Pain points in Model validation**\n\n- **More frequent model validation in the pandemic period which is still a highly manual process**: Bank\u2019s validation teams are working double time (so to say) to make sure they are able to test various validation scenarios (including segments) on BAU models and identify performance gaps.\n\n- **Higher emphasis on \u2018judgement calls\u2019 in the validation process**: We believe validation teams will now go beyond the quantitative assessment of model performance and have a qualitative assessment on strategy rule overlays required as compensating controls for model performance where recalibration might not be feasible in the short term.\n\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**\n\nWith model validation becoming more recurrent during crisis, CP\u2019s comparison and validation capabilities can be leveraged to validate models and overlays quickly. Validation teams can leverage standardized performance dashboards which are preapproved by the risk line of defence and generate all reports and metrics in one place. Automated approval workflows and automated model documentation supports rapid approval cycles and allows validation teams to manage large workloads of model validation in the current crisis.\n\n##### **Pain points in moving Models from analytics to production & feedback loop**\n\n- **Elongated time-to-market for production**: Banks struggle to move analytics to production quickly with the need to recode the model and rule overlays in production, quality checks & extensive testing requirements before deploying into production and deriving benefits.\n\n- **Highly manual test-learn feedback loop**: Bank\u2019s process to \u2018test-learn\u2019 once the analytics have been put to production is also time-consuming and mostly manual.\n\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**\n\nCorridor generates deployable artifacts in a single click. This enables the risk team to spend more time on designing and investigating model and strategy adjustments required as a result of crisis. Moving models from analytics to production becomes trivial in CP. As a feedback loop, performance data from these adjustments can be uploaded on the platform to assess if initial interventions need further refinement and the iteration cycle continues.\n\n##### **Pain points in Model performance monitoring**\n\n- **Segmental performance**: Given the extreme swings in macroeconomic variables which were not available in development data during model build, model performance varies significantly by segments (ex: by Covid-19 regional indicators or employment sectors)\n\n- **One-off crisis response actions**: Massive one-time remedial measures like mass forbearances and federal stimulus checks have skewed the impact of timing and severity of default of retail loans. Models need to be monitored for degradation of performance and business overlays (or strategy rules) need to be actioned as compensating controls.\n\n- **Performance management by exception**: With the large number of models to monitor across products, customer segments and regions, banks model management teams are short-staffed to manage an essentially manual process.\n\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**\n\nCP\u2019s scheduling capability structures and automates continuous monitoring of models impacted due to crisis. Monitoring team would be alerted when the model performance breaches performance thresholds. Model monitoring is automated with the ability to define schedules for iteration counts and time periods for monitoring. CP also supports segmental performance monitoring (ex. product segment, customer segment) to identify model \u2018gaps\u2019 (ex: model performance of a default model for high covid intensity states).\n\nBy addressing these pain points, we believe banks can develop resilient model management to manage the current crisis and overall better prepare to handle crises in the future. Banks also have a great opportunity to upgrade their [decision management technology](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/) and thereby build a sound model management process to develop a sustainable differentiation in the marketplace.\n\n[Bits & Banks - With Aditya Khandekar and Mike Kelly - Episode 3](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-and-mike-kelly-episode-3)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Reva Rao - Episode 2](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-reva-rao-episode-2)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Kevin Moss - Episode 1](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-kevin-moss)\n\n[Contact Us](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/contact-us)\n\n[GenGuardX](https:\/\/ggx.corridorplatforms.com\/)\n\nbottom of page\n\nWe use cookies on our website to see how you interact with it.

We highlight key challenges to the model management process in the current Covid-19 driven crisis and how CP can address some of those challenges.\n\n### **Model Management in Banking**\n\nModel Management is a closed-loop process involving model development\/calibration, model validation, deployment & model monitoring. The overall process requires close coordination among the model development, validation, production and monitoring teams at the bank with robust controls & well-defined interfaces between teams. Speed-to-market and strong governance are critical for banks to compete nimbly and flexibly in the marketplace.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_7666f719b55d45cdbbfda9f029300466~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_634,h_594,al_c,q_90,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_7666f719b55d45cdbbfda9f029300466~mv2.png)\n\nAs an introduction, The Corridor team is mostly banking industry experts who have learned their skill underwriting and managing multi-billion dollar loan books through multiple recessionary cycles. We have taken our experience as end-users and incorporated our learnings in developing an integrated [decision management](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/principle) [workflow automation](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/) platform to help banks\/regulated firms leapfrog legacy decisioning processes and technologies to a next gen capability\/platform needed to win in the age of digitization.\n\n### **Model Development**\n\n- **Authorized access to new data sources with controls**: CP\u2019s highly connected platforms allow rapid incorporation of new data sources with the right level of controls for authorized use, while providing complete flexibility for modelers to leverage AI for innovation in risk modeling while enhancing governance and traceability. In the example below, the account level forbearance data from the bureau is registered and governed for permissible use in models for underwriting with full lineage traceability of use in downstream models.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_33f6fd8db13d4b8cbeb2c486def86bda~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_740,h_327,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_33f6fd8db13d4b8cbeb2c486def86bda~mv2.png)\n\n- **Integrate CP governed & connected data into the full cycle model development process:**\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_f71caa8057f24c44b17ecfb50befe4ab~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_29,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_f71caa8057f24c44b17ecfb50befe4ab~mv2.png)\n\nCP offers a rich library of routines that allow modelers to extract authorized data from CP to their modeling sandboxes though python and then have complete flexibility to use powerful ML\/AI libraries like Anaconda, H2O, PyTorch to build robust models leveraging big data.\n\n- **Rapidly develop and test new decision strategies using \u2018English like\u2019 rule writer**: CP also supports rapid development of strategy overlay rules on model output using a strategy writer engine that is highly intuitive and easy for a policy writer to use. Strategy rules can be defined segment-wise or encompass all segments. In the example below, the score cutoff for default for high affected states by Covid-19 is tightened versus BAU, with an intuitive rule overlay on existing model scores.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_f32dae2e27c84ad29b4f946b34239f99~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_22,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_f32dae2e27c84ad29b4f946b34239f99~mv2.png)\n\n### Model Validation\n\n- **Highly configurable model validation module with workflow automation to support efficient interaction:**\n\n  - CP\u2019s model validation module comes in two variants,\n\n    - Model Validation \u2013 Single model, multiple validation datasets\n\n    - Model Comparison \u2013 Multiple models, single validation datasets (ex: champion challenger scenarios)\n\nThe platform enables the model developer and reviewer to rapidly develop multiple scenarios for model validation (including extensive data segmentation), automate the development of standardized model performance metrics (ex: AUC curve, KS Tables etc.) and track the approval workflow process including multiple approval levels & audit trails through the platform. In the example below, the segmented validation for low FICO applicant base is lower than the benchmark and suggests that the modeler might need to put in some business rule overlays to address the issue. In addition, the following image shows the approval workflows audit engine which supports layered approvals with audit trails.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_c9fd2308cf2b4d33904cb01c533d32de~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_21,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_c9fd2308cf2b4d33904cb01c533d32de~mv2.png)\n\n### **Moving Models from analytics to production & feedback loop**\n\n- **Decision artifact generation**: CP automatically stitches together a standalone artifact that can be deployed seamlessly in the bank\u2019s production systems. The artifact can score in batch (on Spark cluster) or real-time mode (on python) and exactly mirrors the logic developed during the analytic build process.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_ae2dc053646d41edad4de99b701cf1da~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_20,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_ae2dc053646d41edad4de99b701cf1da~mv2.png)\n\n- **Enable rapid test-learn**: CP offers automated workflows to measure impact of decisions based on models by allowing new performance data to be easily loaded and used for the measurement metrics which are standardized across model or product families.\n\n\n### **Model Performance Monitoring**\n\n- **Automated model monitoring** **:** CP provides capabilities for banks to easily set up automated performance monitoring of models at pre-scheduled periods as well as define performance benchmark thresholds, which if breached, resulting in an exception trigger report to the model monitoring team. This automates the monitoring process and facilitates management by exception. In the example below 16 iterations for model tracking on a weekly basis is setup with floor and ceiling AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.55 & 0.85 respectively.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_7ab06dd78a6e48f9989a8104e5472061~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_65,h_40,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_7ab06dd78a6e48f9989a8104e5472061~mv2.png)\n\n- **Segmental performance monitoring**: CP allows the bank to easily setup and measure the segmental performance of BAU models to identify potential model \u2018breaks\u2019. In the example below, the model performance is unstable for the severe Covid-19 affected segment of customers by region (COVID severity cutoffs are based on COVID index defined at regional level).\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_6cec33406e4340b3b05a9d3d1ffcc8f3~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_23,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_6cec33406e4340b3b05a9d3d1ffcc8f3~mv2.png)\n\n### **Ramifications of multiple waves of Covid-19 for Banks\u2019 models**\n\nWe are going through an unprecedented period of uncertainty based on multiple waves of the Covid-19 driven crisis and its economic impact on business sectors, geographic regions and customer behavior. From the chart below, it\u2019s clear that multiple waves of Covid-19 driven crisis will result in uneven impact on different sectors and shape customer behavior in unique new ways.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_ee47bff211974500a4ae8680c4132d61~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_46,h_20,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_ee47bff211974500a4ae8680c4132d61~mv2.png)\n\n_Source: Oliver Wyman insights_\n\nThe Fed recently carried out a sensitivity analysis to assess the threat to banking resulting from the adverse effects of the pandemic. Though all participating banks look sufficiently capitalized for now, 25% of them could report CET1 capital ratio close to the regulatory minimum of 4.5% if the economy witnessed a W shaped recovery trajectory in upcoming quarters. This can be further compounded by Covid-19 waves.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_f2ca4b74084743c4bff2bf8e7829a1c3~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_20,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_f2ca4b74084743c4bff2bf8e7829a1c3~mv2.png)\n\n_Source:_ [_Assessment of Bank Capital during the Recent Coronavirus Event, June 2020_](https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/publications\/files\/2020-sensitivity-analysis-20200625.pdf)\n\nAn obvious implication of the pandemic on banks\u2019 models is that population characteristics have now changed in ways which were unimaginable for most experts at the time those models were built. Sectors like food services and air transport are expected to be impacted quite adversely across crisis scenarios based on analysis done by Oliver Wyman in its recently published report on [model management](https:\/\/www.oliverwyman.com\/our-expertise\/events\/2020\/jun\/covid-19-impact-on-the-us-financial-system-ccar-results-model-management.html#Overview) (see an excerpt on industry analysis from the report below).\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_afddb11823324a2882518079d615d1d4~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_30,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_afddb11823324a2882518079d615d1d4~mv2.png)\n\n_Source: Oliver Wyman \u2013_ [_COVID-19 and Impact on the U_](https:\/\/www.mmc.com\/content\/dam\/mmc-web\/insights\/publications\/2020\/july\/Oliver-Wyman-Webinar-COVID-19-CCAR-and-MRM.pdf) [_S_](https:\/\/www.mmc.com\/content\/dam\/mmc-web\/insights\/publications\/2020\/july\/Oliver-Wyman-Webinar-COVID-19-CCAR-and-MRM.pdf) [_Financial System July 2020_](https:\/\/www.mmc.com\/content\/dam\/mmc-web\/insights\/publications\/2020\/july\/Oliver-Wyman-Webinar-COVID-19-CCAR-and-MRM.pdf)\n\n### **Strategic challenges for model management in retail credit and potential solutions leveraging Corridor\u2019s decision management suite**\n\n##### **Pain points in Model development**\n\n- **Relationships between predictors and outcome broken in crisis period**: Due to the extreme and uncharted impact of Covid-19, traditional model relationships might break. For example, relationships between macroeconomic variables and default due to large scale deferrals. Banks have options for:\n\n  - **_Retrain models using new data safely_**: Banks need the ability to bring in new data (ex: Bureau forbearances at loan level) with robust control & governance and safely incorporate that data for model retraining with right permissible use.\n\n  - **_Build business overlay strategies for short term model fixes_**: Banks also need the ability to quickly update their decisions strategies (or business overlays) based on models. Due to lack of historical data or precedence in a highly uncertain environment, banks need the ability to use expert judgment and assumptions driven decision strategies instead of model retraining.\n- **Flexibility in model development required due to lack of specific guidance in the pandemic period**: Banks need the flexibility to develop multiple training datasets with exclusion\/inclusion criteria's and segmental dataset which are approved for use by 1st\/2nd line of defence teams and have strict governance protocols for model build and scenarios planning.\n\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**\n\nCorridor\u2019s fully integrated solution facilitates necessary adjustments and recalibration of impacted ML models. \u2018English like\u2019 rule writer helps enhance models with expert judgement based overlays quickly (ex: stricter underwriting rules for worst-affected customer segments) that are essential in an uncertain crisis period with limited data availability for robust recalibration. Strong focus on governance & connectivity between model and strategies ensures that all there are no compliance violations (ex: fair lending requirements). The updated models and\/or strategies can be quickly extracted as artifacts for production scoring.\n\n##### **Pain points in Model validation**\n\n- **More frequent model validation in the pandemic period which is still a highly manual process**: Bank\u2019s validation teams are working double time (so to say) to make sure they are able to test various validation scenarios (including segments) on BAU models and identify performance gaps.\n\n- **Higher emphasis on \u2018judgement calls\u2019 in the validation process**: We believe validation teams will now go beyond the quantitative assessment of model performance and have a qualitative assessment on strategy rule overlays required as compensating controls for model performance where recalibration might not be feasible in the short term.\n\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**\n\nWith model validation becoming more recurrent during crisis, CP\u2019s comparison and validation capabilities can be leveraged to validate models and overlays quickly. Validation teams can leverage standardized performance dashboards which are preapproved by the risk line of defence and generate all reports and metrics in one place. Automated approval workflows and automated model documentation supports rapid approval cycles and allows validation teams to manage large workloads of model validation in the current crisis.\n\n##### **Pain points in moving Models from analytics to production & feedback loop**\n\n- **Elongated time-to-market for production**: Banks struggle to move analytics to production quickly with the need to recode the model and rule overlays in production, quality checks & extensive testing requirements before deploying into production and deriving benefits.\n\n- **Highly manual test-learn feedback loop**: Bank\u2019s process to \u2018test-learn\u2019 once the analytics have been put to production is also time-consuming and mostly manual.\n\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**\n\nCorridor generates deployable artifacts in a single click.

The artifact can score in batch (on Spark cluster) or real-time mode (on python) and exactly mirrors the logic developed during the analytic build process.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_ae2dc053646d41edad4de99b701cf1da~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_20,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_ae2dc053646d41edad4de99b701cf1da~mv2.png)\n\n- **Enable rapid test-learn**: CP offers automated workflows to measure impact of decisions based on models by allowing new performance data to be easily loaded and used for the measurement metrics which are standardized across model or product families.\n\n\n### **Model Performance Monitoring**\n\n- **Automated model monitoring** **:** CP provides capabilities for banks to easily set up automated performance monitoring of models at pre-scheduled periods as well as define performance benchmark thresholds, which if breached, resulting in an exception trigger report to the model monitoring team. This automates the monitoring process and facilitates management by exception. In the example below 16 iterations for model tracking on a weekly basis is setup with floor and ceiling AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.55 & 0.85 respectively.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_7ab06dd78a6e48f9989a8104e5472061~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_65,h_40,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_7ab06dd78a6e48f9989a8104e5472061~mv2.png)\n\n- **Segmental performance monitoring**: CP allows the bank to easily setup and measure the segmental performance of BAU models to identify potential model \u2018breaks\u2019. In the example below, the model performance is unstable for the severe Covid-19 affected segment of customers by region (COVID severity cutoffs are based on COVID index defined at regional level).\n\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_6cec33406e4340b3b05a9d3d1ffcc8f3~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_23,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_6cec33406e4340b3b05a9d3d1ffcc8f3~mv2.png)\n\n### **Ramifications of multiple waves of Covid-19 for Banks\u2019 models**\n\nWe are going through an unprecedented period of uncertainty based on multiple waves of the Covid-19 driven crisis and its economic impact on business sectors, geographic regions and customer behavior. From the chart below, it\u2019s clear that multiple waves of Covid-19 driven crisis will result in uneven impact on different sectors and shape customer behavior in unique new ways.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_ee47bff211974500a4ae8680c4132d61~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_46,h_20,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_ee47bff211974500a4ae8680c4132d61~mv2.png)\n\n_Source: Oliver Wyman insights_\n\nThe Fed recently carried out a sensitivity analysis to assess the threat to banking resulting from the adverse effects of the pandemic. Though all participating banks look sufficiently capitalized for now, 25% of them could report CET1 capital ratio close to the regulatory minimum of 4.5% if the economy witnessed a W shaped recovery trajectory in upcoming quarters. This can be further compounded by Covid-19 waves.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_f2ca4b74084743c4bff2bf8e7829a1c3~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_20,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_f2ca4b74084743c4bff2bf8e7829a1c3~mv2.png)\n\n_Source:_ [_Assessment of Bank Capital during the Recent Coronavirus Event, June 2020_](https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/publications\/files\/2020-sensitivity-analysis-20200625.pdf)\n\nAn obvious implication of the pandemic on banks\u2019 models is that population characteristics have now changed in ways which were unimaginable for most experts at the time those models were built.

For example, relationships between macroeconomic variables and default due to large scale deferrals. Banks have options for:\n\n  - **_Retrain models using new data safely_**: Banks need the ability to bring in new data (ex: Bureau forbearances at loan level) with robust control & governance and safely incorporate that data for model retraining with right permissible use.\n\n  - **_Build business overlay strategies for short term model fixes_**: Banks also need the ability to quickly update their decisions strategies (or business overlays) based on models. Due to lack of historical data or precedence in a highly uncertain environment, banks need the ability to use expert judgment and assumptions driven decision strategies instead of model retraining.\n- **Flexibility in model development required due to lack of specific guidance in the pandemic period**: Banks need the flexibility to develop multiple training datasets with exclusion\/inclusion criteria's and segmental dataset which are approved for use by 1st\/2nd line of defence teams and have strict governance protocols for model build and scenarios planning.\n\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**\n\nCorridor\u2019s fully integrated solution facilitates necessary adjustments and recalibration of impacted ML models. \u2018English like\u2019 rule writer helps enhance models with expert judgement based overlays quickly (ex: stricter underwriting rules for worst-affected customer segments) that are essential in an uncertain crisis period with limited data availability for robust recalibration. Strong focus on governance & connectivity between model and strategies ensures that all there are no compliance violations (ex: fair lending requirements). The updated models and\/or strategies can be quickly extracted as artifacts for production scoring.\n\n##### **Pain points in Model validation**\n\n- **More frequent model validation in the pandemic period which is still a highly manual process**: Bank\u2019s validation teams are working double time (so to say) to make sure they are able to test various validation scenarios (including segments) on BAU models and identify performance gaps.\n\n- **Higher emphasis on \u2018judgement calls\u2019 in the validation process**: We believe validation teams will now go beyond the quantitative assessment of model performance and have a qualitative assessment on strategy rule overlays required as compensating controls for model performance where recalibration might not be feasible in the short term.\n\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**\n\nWith model validation becoming more recurrent during crisis, CP\u2019s comparison and validation capabilities can be leveraged to validate models and overlays quickly. Validation teams can leverage standardized performance dashboards which are preapproved by the risk line of defence and generate all reports and metrics in one place. Automated approval workflows and automated model documentation supports rapid approval cycles and allows validation teams to manage large workloads of model validation in the current crisis.\n\n##### **Pain points in moving Models from analytics to production & feedback loop**\n\n- **Elongated time-to-market for production**: Banks struggle to move analytics to production quickly with the need to recode the model and rule overlays in production, quality checks & extensive testing requirements before deploying into production and deriving benefits.\n\n- **Highly manual test-learn feedback loop**: Bank\u2019s process to \u2018test-learn\u2019 once the analytics have been put to production is also time-consuming and mostly manual.\n\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**\n\nCorridor generates deployable artifacts in a single click. This enables the risk team to spend more time on designing and investigating model and strategy adjustments required as a result of crisis. Moving models from analytics to production becomes trivial in CP. As a feedback loop, performance data from these adjustments can be uploaded on the platform to assess if initial interventions need further refinement and the iteration cycle continues.\n\n##### **Pain points in Model performance monitoring**\n\n- **Segmental performance**: Given the extreme swings in macroeconomic variables which were not available in development data during model build, model performance varies significantly by segments (ex: by Covid-19 regional indicators or employment sectors)\n\n- **One-off crisis response actions**: Massive one-time remedial measures like mass forbearances and federal stimulus checks have skewed the impact of timing and severity of default of retail loans. Models need to be monitored for degradation of performance and business overlays (or strategy rules) need to be actioned as compensating controls.\n\n- **Performance management by exception**: With the large number of models to monitor across products, customer segments and regions, banks model management teams are short-staffed to manage an essentially manual process.\n\n\n##### **Corridor Solution**\n\nCP\u2019s scheduling capability structures and automates continuous monitoring of models impacted due to crisis. Monitoring team would be alerted when the model performance breaches performance thresholds. Model monitoring is automated with the ability to define schedules for iteration counts and time periods for monitoring. CP also supports segmental performance monitoring (ex. product segment, customer segment) to identify model \u2018gaps\u2019 (ex: model performance of a default model for high covid intensity states).\n\nBy addressing these pain points, we believe banks can develop resilient model management to manage the current crisis and overall better prepare to handle crises in the future. Banks also have a great opportunity to upgrade their [decision management technology](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/) and thereby build a sound model management process to develop a sustainable differentiation in the marketplace.\n\n[Bits & Banks - With Aditya Khandekar and Mike Kelly - Episode 3](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-and-mike-kelly-episode-3)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Reva Rao - Episode 2](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-reva-rao-episode-2)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Kevin Moss - Episode 1](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-kevin-moss)\n\n[Contact Us](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/contact-us)\n\n[GenGuardX](https:\/\/ggx.corridorplatforms.com\/)\n\nbottom of page\n\nWe use cookies on our website to see how you interact with it.

They expect innovative, convenient, and easy-to-use digital tools in every facet of their lives\u2014and financial products are no exception. Digital lending is now imperative as table stakes, it\u2019s no longer just a nice-to-have service option.\n\nAs digitization of banking products and service offerings has ramped up, customers expect personalized treatment, like one might experience personalized service with Amazon or Uber. The bar is high!\n\nMost consumers prefer to apply for loans online. As such, product flexibility, straightforward application processes, and swift decision- making capabilities by lenders are key. Building an online lending platform is not enough. Online lenders also need to provide well-targeted offers at the point of need, utilizing the full spectrum of real-time contextual and customer permissioned data.\n\nDelivering a superior and near-instantaneous experience rests on excellent digital capabilities, advanced modeling techniques, and new data streams. Larger banks have had several years to reach this point and are still fine-tuning algorithms and ironing out compliance issues. But smaller banks must also embrace precise credit assessment based on better AI, automated and customized digital decisioning workflows quickly to compete in the current recessionary environment \u2013 else they could suffer adverse selection.\n\nModern Decisioning Challenges for Credit Unions and Community Banks\n\nIt is imperative that credit unions and community banks offer consumers a fully automated, responsive, and personalized digital lending platform. However, this requires a level of decisioning capability that comes with its own set of complications.\n\nBelow are some of the particular challenges posed by data and analytics, in tandem with decisioning technology and need for frictionless customer experience.\n\n**Data**\n\nBanks have access to a wealth of customer data, from credit history to income and bank statement data, as well as utility payment data. However, this means little without the requisite governance capabilities to use this data for real-time decisioning.\n\nThere has been a proliferation of new data sources, both structured and unstructured. Mid-tier banks often struggle to deal with the sheer scale of these new inputs. The central challenge is to overcome a legacy decisioning lifecycle that is based on simple decision-making rules using bureau scores versus sophisticated custom ML and manual compliance and governance processes. In addition, there are risks associated with the uncontrolled usage of sensitive data\u2014not to mention an overlong, expensive learning curve.\n\n> Faced with operational and regulatory bottlenecks, how can smaller banks hold their own against the dominant players? Especially when larger entities have access to better data to make contextual offers at the right time.\n\nTo be competitive, mid-sized lenders must implement secure and well-governed cloud architecture for decisioning. Key features of this new infrastructure must include access to external and internal bank data, as well as APIs for instant decisioning. Institutions unable to create attractive and meaningful digital product offerings will face major negative select at acquisition which creates losses downstream, not ideal in an impending recession.\n\n**Analytics** Community banks and credit unions need a sophisticated machine learning and AI decisioning platform to compete with Tier 1 banks\u2019 value propositions. This requires professional talents and resources of sophisticated in-house decisioning analytics.\n\nThe current model risk management frameworks are fairly manual, including handoffs, then back and forth between modeling teams and compliance teams, which may have been sufficient for traditional modeling capabilities so far. However, with the increased sophistication of analytics modeling technique, these manual handoffs now become a barrier and create significant speed lag in terms of speed-to-market and ability to monitor and track decisions.\n\nBreak down is inevitable.\n\nToday\u2019s dynamic digital lending marketplace demands ready-to-use decisioning and machine learning. If banks wish to remain viable, upgrading analytics to provide for at-scale development, efficient processes, automated monitoring, and transparent governance is no longer a choice-it\u2019s a necessity.\n\n**Decision Tech & Customer Experience**\n\nSuccessful lending institutions rely on advanced analytics and real-time, interactive decisioning at point of need to optimize the customer experience and improve uptake rates. That means offering fast-yet well-constructed risk appetite loan decisions.Upgrading decisioning technology and compliance allows for rapid iterations and quick deployment. Based on systemic governance, workflow automation, automated monitoring, and pre-vetted or standardized compliance dashboards.\n\nFully automated, digital-first lending platforms must also ensure regulatory compliance. For instance, [Consumer Financial Protection](https:\/\/www.nafcu.org\/compliance-blog\/cfpb-issues-advisory-opinion-ecoa-and-reg-b) Bureau (CFPB) advisory makes it clear that the prohibition on discrimination applies not just at origination but through the lifetime of a loan.\n\nBottom-line, banks cannot afford to make mistakes. So systematic governance and ready-to-use compliance artifacts is a core capability, not a function that can be outsourced as a small piece of the puzzle. The full lifecycle of the loan and ongoing efforts to comply is a necessary activity to keep and build as an in-house capability.\n\nIn the absence of appropriate decisioning technology and contextual information, smaller banks will be unable to provide consumers with fast, personalized, loan offers. It follows that customers who don\u2019t receive the anticipated level of service will soon switch to an institution that\u2019s more responsive to their needs, and those applicants who come to the bank might be the ones you do not want to approve due to adverse selection.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_aa798fa71a934bcca932f3cf7114f878~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_59,h_38,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_aa798fa71a934bcca932f3cf7114f878~mv2.png)\n\nSource : Shutterstock\n\n**Decision-as-a-Service: The Next-Gen Solution for Real-Time Decisioning**\n\nThe rapid uptake of digital lending has put many mid-sized and regional banks at a significant disadvantage as they lack the tech infrastructure required to support real-time decisioning.\n\nThe time is now to level the playing field with a solution built to provide ready-to-use features able to handle data, run analytics, and sharpen automated, on-the-fly decisioning.\n\nDecision-as-a-Service (DaaS) solutions give community banks and credit unions off-the-shelf Tier 1 capability, marked by speedy digital decisioning and robust analytical capabilities.

Due to this escalating demand, a growing number of financial institutions now offer relevant, real-time digital lending products.\n\nThe digitization of banking has fundamentally transformed the financial landscape. Traditional lending practices are no longer enough to survive, let alone thrive in today\u2019s market. Credit unions and mid-tier banks may have invested in front-end digitization. However, most still lack the sophisticated decisioning capabilities to compete with Tier 1 banks. Uplifting decisioning requires automating and uplifting the entire decisioning workflow; starting with controls on data, creating models at scale, and then using them in decisioning strategies with strict compliance, for example in underwriting, risk-based pricing, collections and proactive marketing.\n\nIf Tier 2 banks want to retain and grow their customer base, upgrading their overall digital decisioning process from data infrastructure to decision analytics, and robust governance and compliance with flexibility and speed is crucial.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_a529455b9fb647d196deadc3ad45166a~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_709,h_462,al_c,lg_1,q_85,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_a529455b9fb647d196deadc3ad45166a~mv2.png)\n\nSource : Shutterstock\n\n### Digital Lending: A New Landscape for Banking and Financial Services\n\nModern consumers are increasingly tech-savvy. They expect innovative, convenient, and easy-to-use digital tools in every facet of their lives\u2014and financial products are no exception. Digital lending is now imperative as table stakes, it\u2019s no longer just a nice-to-have service option.\n\nAs digitization of banking products and service offerings has ramped up, customers expect personalized treatment, like one might experience personalized service with Amazon or Uber. The bar is high!\n\nMost consumers prefer to apply for loans online. As such, product flexibility, straightforward application processes, and swift decision- making capabilities by lenders are key. Building an online lending platform is not enough. Online lenders also need to provide well-targeted offers at the point of need, utilizing the full spectrum of real-time contextual and customer permissioned data.\n\nDelivering a superior and near-instantaneous experience rests on excellent digital capabilities, advanced modeling techniques, and new data streams. Larger banks have had several years to reach this point and are still fine-tuning algorithms and ironing out compliance issues. But smaller banks must also embrace precise credit assessment based on better AI, automated and customized digital decisioning workflows quickly to compete in the current recessionary environment \u2013 else they could suffer adverse selection.\n\nModern Decisioning Challenges for Credit Unions and Community Banks\n\nIt is imperative that credit unions and community banks offer consumers a fully automated, responsive, and personalized digital lending platform. However, this requires a level of decisioning capability that comes with its own set of complications.\n\nBelow are some of the particular challenges posed by data and analytics, in tandem with decisioning technology and need for frictionless customer experience.\n\n**Data**\n\nBanks have access to a wealth of customer data, from credit history to income and bank statement data, as well as utility payment data. However, this means little without the requisite governance capabilities to use this data for real-time decisioning.\n\nThere has been a proliferation of new data sources, both structured and unstructured. Mid-tier banks often struggle to deal with the sheer scale of these new inputs. The central challenge is to overcome a legacy decisioning lifecycle that is based on simple decision-making rules using bureau scores versus sophisticated custom ML and manual compliance and governance processes. In addition, there are risks associated with the uncontrolled usage of sensitive data\u2014not to mention an overlong, expensive learning curve.\n\n> Faced with operational and regulatory bottlenecks, how can smaller banks hold their own against the dominant players? Especially when larger entities have access to better data to make contextual offers at the right time.\n\nTo be competitive, mid-sized lenders must implement secure and well-governed cloud architecture for decisioning. Key features of this new infrastructure must include access to external and internal bank data, as well as APIs for instant decisioning. Institutions unable to create attractive and meaningful digital product offerings will face major negative select at acquisition which creates losses downstream, not ideal in an impending recession.\n\n**Analytics** Community banks and credit unions need a sophisticated machine learning and AI decisioning platform to compete with Tier 1 banks\u2019 value propositions. This requires professional talents and resources of sophisticated in-house decisioning analytics.\n\nThe current model risk management frameworks are fairly manual, including handoffs, then back and forth between modeling teams and compliance teams, which may have been sufficient for traditional modeling capabilities so far. However, with the increased sophistication of analytics modeling technique, these manual handoffs now become a barrier and create significant speed lag in terms of speed-to-market and ability to monitor and track decisions.\n\nBreak down is inevitable.\n\nToday\u2019s dynamic digital lending marketplace demands ready-to-use decisioning and machine learning. If banks wish to remain viable, upgrading analytics to provide for at-scale development, efficient processes, automated monitoring, and transparent governance is no longer a choice-it\u2019s a necessity.\n\n**Decision Tech & Customer Experience**\n\nSuccessful lending institutions rely on advanced analytics and real-time, interactive decisioning at point of need to optimize the customer experience and improve uptake rates.

Upon confirmation, the job will no longer be tracked in the Metrics Dashboard.\n\n### Selecting Another Job (When a Job Was Previously Selected) [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/deploy-and-monitor\/performance\/\\#selecting-another-job-when-a-job-was-previously-selected \"Permanent link\")\n\n- To select another job when a job was previously chosen, follow these steps:\n- Go to the approved Object's page and access the Jobs Tab.\n- For each row in the Jobs tab, observe the following conditions:\n  - If there is no action link for MD, the job is not eligible based on the criteria mentioned earlier\n  - If the action link \"Select for Metrics MD\" is shown, the job is eligible for selection\n  - If the action link \"Unselect Job for MD\" shows, the currently selected row corresponds to the job previously chosen.\n- Click on \"Select for Metrics MD\" for the job you wish to select.\n\n- Upon confirmation, the newly selected job will be used to track the object in the Metrics Dashboard.\n\n### Tracking Metrics and Handling Job Iterations [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/deploy-and-monitor\/performance\/\\#tracking-metrics-and-handling-job-iterations \"Permanent link\")\n\n- Users can continue tracking metrics with recurring simulations. When job iterations end:\n- Before job completion, notifications\/emails can be sent to warn that there is only one iteration left.\n- Upon job tracking completion, additional notifications\/emails can be sent.\n- After job completion:\n  - If a user selects a new recurring job, it will be used from the time the new job was selected\n  - If a user unselects the current recurring job, it will be stopped from the time the job was selected\n  - If a user takes no action, the last iteration will continue to be shown in the Metrics Dashboard.\n\n### Metrics Display and Thresholds [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/deploy-and-monitor\/performance\/\\#metrics-display-and-thresholds \"Permanent link\")\n\n- The Metrics Dashboard will exclusively showcase the latest completed job selected by the user.\n\n- There won't be a default base view, ensuring that the dashboard remains streamlined and focused on user preferences.\n\n- Only the metrics registered through the UI for the specific object will be presented.\n\n\n**Note**: The thresholds utilized on the Job page during individual simulations will not be visible within the Metrics Dashboard.\n\n### Data View [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/deploy-and-monitor\/performance\/\\#data-view \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis view presents the complete data for the selected object type in a tabular format. Users can easily navigate to specific objects by clicking on the rows. Additionally, they can apply filters or sort rows based on any specified column.\n\nThe data view is a comprehensive place to access all information across the entire platform - and is the base for nearly all other types of monitoring - be it creating Custom Views or creating automated Alerts.\n\n### Automated Alerts [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/deploy-and-monitor\/performance\/\\#automated-alerts \"Permanent link\")\n\nAlerts are defined as a set of rules that are designed to identify specific items or events that require immediate attention or further action. These rules are created based on predefined criteria, enabling the system to detect critical situations, anomalies, or deviations from expected behaviour. When the conditions specified in the alert rules are met, the system triggers events such as notifications, emails etc. ensuring that appropriate actions can be taken promptly to address the identified issues.\n\n### Creating Alerts [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/deploy-and-monitor\/performance\/\\#creating-alerts \"Permanent link\")\n\nOn the platform, users have the flexibility to create custom alerts tailored to their specific needs. Custom alerts encompass essential properties, including name, description, conditions, severity, and associated actions.\n\n- Click on **Settings** icon and select **Alerts** in the dropdown menu option. Now you can view a list of alerts configured for the dashboard.\n- Click on **Create**.\n- Define the **Alert Name** by editing the New Alert header.\n- **Severity**: Each custom alert can be assigned a severity level, such as _High_, _Medium_, or _Low_. This categorization allows users to prioritize alerts based on their importance and urgency. Different severity levels help stakeholders focus on critical issues\n- **Table Name**: Select the table name from the dropdown menu.\n- **Activate**: Click the activate checkbox to mark the alert as active. Activated alerts are evaluated, and the corresponding data is displayed as columns in the Monitoring Dashboard. Muted alerts are temporarily disabled and not evaluated, meaning they won't appear as columns in the dashboard during that period.\n- Fill in the description for the new **Custom Alert**.\n\n- **Actions**\nChoose an action type from the \"Type\" dropdown menu to determine the action that will be executed when the alert is triggered. The following actions can be associated with custom alerts:\n  - **Send Notification**: The system can send notifications to selected users, or user roles informing them about the triggered alert.\n  - **Add Alert Flag**: When an alert condition is met, users have the option to add a predefined flag to the object responsible for the alert. Flags serve as visual indicators to highlight objects that require attention.\n  - **Create Review**: For Approved objects, users can choose to add an ongoing review to the object's responsibility and assign reviewers. This action facilitates a thorough review process for objects flagged by the custom alert.\n  - **Send Email**: Users can configure the system to send email notifications to external users when an alert is triggered. The custom field associated with the objects should contain a string of comma-separated email addresses for users who should receive these emails.\n\nNote\n\nMultiple actions can be triggered based on an alert.\n\n- **Conditions**: Define the conditions that need to be met for an alert to be generated. These conditions are specified using rules based on the columns available in the Monitoring Dashboard Data. By utilizing data from the dashboard, users can set up criteria that trigger the alert when specific thresholds or patterns are detected.\n\n- Click on **Create** to register the alert. A pop-up toast message will be displayed with the text reading Alert Created Successfully.\n\n\nWas this page helpful?","62","https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/deploy-and-monitor\/performance\/","Performance Tracking - Corridor GGX Documentation","Core Product : GenGuardX","Evaluation #1","What types of actions can be triggered when a custom alert's conditions are met?","When a custom alert's conditions are met, the following actions can be triggered: sending a notification to selected users or user roles, adding a predefined flag to the object responsible for the alert, creating a review for approved objects, or sending an email to external users.","1.0","The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output aligns perfectly with the retrieval context!

Banks with sub optimal decisioning capabilities could potentially lose out on good customers or get adverse select (in recessionary times) and b. product acceptance rates can be significantly lower due to competition with best-in-class banks (in digital marketplace) as well as disconnect to customer\u2019s needs. **_Banks need to be able to react quickly to these dynamics to stay competitive._**\n\nIf banks are able re-engineer their build, evaluate, and approve decision process with left shift decision paradigm, they will _perform only relevant_ business analysis and compliance checks at each iteration more thoroughly versus testing for everything. **_Hence, they will shorten reaction time to competitor moves and customer needs while reducing overall potential for regulatory and reputational risk._**\n\n**_This can become a sustain differentiator in a volatile recessionary environment currently where best-in-class implementers of left shift decisioning paradigm can gain un-proportional market share and win against lagging competitors._**\n\n[Bits & Banks - With Aditya Khandekar and Mike Kelly - Episode 3](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-and-mike-kelly-episode-3)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Reva Rao - Episode 2](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-reva-rao-episode-2)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Kevin Moss - Episode 1](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-kevin-moss)\n\n[Contact Us](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/contact-us)\n\n[GenGuardX](https:\/\/ggx.corridorplatforms.com\/)\n\nbottom of page\n\nWe use cookies on our website to see how you interact with it.

With Cleanlab one can can systematically identify hallucinations, off-topic responses, unsafe outputs, and other critical issues across agents, RAG pipelines, and broader LLM workflows. Cleanlab\u2019s metrics and scores can be used to create insightful reports for validating systems and can also serve as guardrails to ensure your agents respond safely.\n\n### Key Use Cases [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/integrations\/evaluation_libraries\/cleanlab\/\\#key-use-cases \"Permanent link\")\n\n- **RAG System Evaluation**\n\n\nAutomatically detect inaccuracies, assess retrieval quality, and surface knowledge gaps in RAG pipelines.\n\n- **Agent & Pipeline Response Evaluation**\n\n\nCleanlab\u2019s TLM (Trustworthiness Language Model) assigns confidence scores to LLM responses, flagging hallucinations, ambiguous answers, and unsafe content with detailed explanations.\n\n- **Data Quality & Reliability**\n\n\nIdentify and resolve issues such as mislabeled data, ambiguous examples, or statistical outliers ensuring your models are trained or validated on clean, trustworthy data.\n\n\n### Example Use Case: Enhancing IVR System Evaluation with Cleanlab [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/integrations\/evaluation_libraries\/cleanlab\/\\#example-use-case-enhancing-ivr-system-evaluation-with-cleanlab \"Permanent link\")\n\nCleanlab significantly help test IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems by providing trustworthiness scores for various AI-driven processes. It evaluates the reliability of LLM decisions in classifying caller intent and routing calls, providing responses. Furthermore, Cleanlab can assesses the accuracy of human data labels used in validation, helping to pinpoint mislabeled data. For the auto-generated call summaries and candidate responses, Cleanlab's scores can highlight problematic outputs and areas where the agent may need further improvement.\n\n[![alt text](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/integrations\/evaluation_libraries\/raw_trust_score.png)](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/integrations\/evaluation_libraries\/raw_trust_score.png)\n\nfor e.g. Check below, Cleanlab can score how trustworthy each response is, making it easy to spot which types of questions or categories have issues.\n\n[![alt text](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/integrations\/evaluation_libraries\/trust_score.png)](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/integrations\/evaluation_libraries\/trust_score.png)\n\n## Want to Learn More ?

Customers are comfortable having multiple banking relationships with a best-of-breed approach.\n\nA pressing question is: _How can Community FIs adopt digitization to keep pace with the best-in-class institutions_? Especially when instant credit introduces fresh risk and control complexities, which is worsened by the unpredictable payment behavior of consumers in the post-pandemic landscape.\n\nWelcome to the Digital Lending Revolution. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n### **Impact of Digitization on Consumer Expectations and FIs**\n\nToday\u2019s consumers expect instant gratification, including better contextual offers, quicker approval cycles and disbursement times. Should institutions lag in delivering on this expectation, they risk falling behind.\n\nFor the consumer \u2013 the landscape is rich with possibilities, as they are presented with many credit offers in real-time and have the freedom to select the optimal choice tailored to their specific needs and preferences. This means that Community FIs and sophisticated lenders are now contending for the very same consumers.\n\nThe competition to win and retain customers has intensified, prompting a continuous cycle of industry-wide innovation. Community FIs need to now rapidly invest in advanced digital technologies including decisioning and streamlined processes for acquisition\/retention for the best consumer experience. In a mature market, FIs now must set themselves apart to attract and retain consumers, as an exceptional digital consumer experience can be a crucial factor for their success.\n\nCertain FIs, often the first movers, have gained a competitive edge by already spending a few years upgrading talent, processes, and infrastructure. For the majority of the FIs that opted to follow suit, it becomes apparent that the transformation needed to compete effectively is anything but quick, especially when hindered by legacy processes and technology.\n\n### **Digital Lending: The What?**\n\nDigital Lending refers to an automated lending process, facilitating instantaneous loan discovery, approval and disbursal and subsequently digital customer management for servicing.\n\nAs the digital landscape continues to evolve, institutions are progressively depending more on sophisticated real-time analytics, automated approvals and workflow automation to run their lending lifecycles. By achieving faster turnaround times and expediting time-to-market, digital lending is enabling institutions to enhance and automate either the entire lending process or specific segments of it.\n\nHowever, where did this all begin?\n\nThe initial phase centered on automating loan originations \u2013 streamlining the assessment of applicant creditworthiness. Subsequently, the focus shifted to enhancing the customer experience, transitioning to a paperless approach with digitized e-signatures and contracts. This not only expedited processing but also enabled the tracking of compliance-related documentation.\n\nNow, best-in-class digital lending has developed into a complete end-to-end loan origination process \u2013 a seamlessly integrated solution that enhances the consumer experience, driven by all digital front-end orchestration and CRM, middleware decisioning logic and backend fulfillment, leveraging all digital tech.\n\n### **Major Growth Factors**\n\nNumerous factors are driving the expansion of digital lending and augmenting the customer experience.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_1ea9de686e62433799edde51c0d67e0a~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_28,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_1ea9de686e62433799edde51c0d67e0a~mv2.png)\n\n##### **1) Tech-Savvy Millennials & Gen-Z Reshaping the Market Dynamics**\n\nThe post-pandemic era witnessed a rapid transformation in consumer buying behavior. With the necessity of visiting physical stores diminishing, consumers now anticipate instant gratification across various domains, spanning from online food delivery and everyday essentials to instant credit.\n\nCombine this with the fact that tech-savvy Millennials and Gen Z now dominate as the largest generational groups in the U.S., and we\u2019ve got ourselves a seismic shift in the expectation of the financial industry. According to a [Morgan Stanley research](https:\/\/www.morganstanley.com\/ideas\/millennial-gen-z-loan-growth), Millennials are now the largest driver of net new-loan demand, and will remain so for the next decade.\n\nThis is both an opportunity and a challenge for Community FIs.\n\n**Upgrading decisioning capabilities, driving process efficiencies and enhancing analytical talent have become imperative steps for Community FIs to level the playing field effectively.**\n\n##### **2) Data and Analytical Sophistication**\n\nDigital data is everywhere. With nearly two-thirds of the global population having access to a smartphone, we are in the midst of a groundbreaking era of digital engagement. The result? A wealth of financial and non-financial data that FIs can harness for enhanced decision-making.\n\nAnalytical sophistication can drive data-driven offers and recommendations, dynamic pricing, early-detection of fraud, more precise risk assessments (credit, KYC, Fraud etc.) and better decisioning for prospecting and cross-selling. Amidst this wealth of data, FIs possess the potential to revolutionize the consumer experience.\n\n##### **3) Optimization of Speed and Cost**\n\nHarnessing technological advancements, digital lending has eliminated operational inefficiencies while significantly expediting the credit approval and dispersal process.\n\nBy implementing automated underwriting and approvals, financial institutions can now provide real-time credit offers, effectively eliminating time inefficiencies and significantly enhancing customer engagement. Moreover, they can easily monitor, test, learn, and adapt their strategies to ensure optimal outcomes. It is critically important to be nimble and react quickly to marketplace and prospect\/customer dynamics in real-time.\n\nThis process not only ensures shorter time-to-market, but also proves highly cost-effective, as automation mitigates the manual inefficiencies that often burden legacy lenders.\n\n### **How Does Digital Lending Differ from Traditional Lending?**\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_f47c375405204135a8caced453669659~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_28,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_f47c375405204135a8caced453669659~mv2.png)\n\nDigital credit consumers possess the agility to swiftly switch to their preferred lender \u2013 facilitated by the simple process of applying to numerous digital lenders at the same time. This stands in contrast to traditional lending, where consumers typically applied for loans physically, often at the bank where they held their deposits and payroll intake, through paper applications that took several days for a decision. If approved, consumers received the loan or credit card, which they then began utilizing.\n\nToday, consumers can simply go online, receive instantaneous offers from multiple banks upon submitting their application, and accept the most favorable one in real-time. For instance, they might choose one offer out of the four available. This scenario underscores the **concept of acceptance rate**: if a bank approves and extends offers to four consumer applications and one of them accepts, the bank\u2019s acceptance rate stands at 25%. This poses a significant challenge for all financial institutions. We will delve deeper into this concept in our next blog **.**\n\n### **Challenges of the Digital Lending Revolution**\n\nHaving navigated through the landscape of digital lending, let\u2019s now pivot to the challenges that Community FIs may encounter when embarking on this transformative journey.\n\n##### **1) Adopting a Fragmented Strategy over a Holistic Approach**\n\nThe most significant pitfall that financial institutions can encounter is tackling digitization in a fragmented fashion. Mere digitization or automation of isolated processes to address specific issues can lead to complexities, potentially necessitating a return to manual operations due to inadequate integration of these automated processes within the system. While the significant costs \u2013 in terms of both time and resources associated with a complete end-to-end transformation of lending solutions are understandable, it\u2019s often wiser to adopt a modular approach. This approach focuses on enhancing all the facets of a particular process \u2013 whether it\u2019s prospecting or underwriting.\n\n##### **2) Siloed Processes**\n\nFinancial institutions must prioritize the integration of all decision components within their ecosystem for seamless interaction and coordination. Siloed processes can lead to multiple inefficiencies and effectively delay time-to-market. In an increasingly competitive landscape, lenders should have the capability to access all necessary information on a unified platform in real-time to deliver hyper-personalized services to customers that can truly resonate with their financial needs and preferences. Without a comprehensive 360-degree customer view, financial institutions might struggle to enhance customer engagement and miss out on opportunities for effectively cross-selling new lending products.\n\n##### **3) Staying Compliant \u2013 \u2018Speed with Safety\u2019**\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of rules and regulations in the consumer lending industry, FIs may find it challenging to stay compliant without the support of a robust governance platform. Digital borrowers often divulge significant amounts of sensitive information while applying for loans \u2013 and automated processes, not humans, often drive loan decisions. Having system driven guardrails on a configurable platform to stay in compliance is critical \u2013 we call it \u2018speed with safety\u2019.\n\nWhile these represent the primary challenges faced by Community FIs, we\u2019ll delve deeper into these aspects in the upcoming second part of our series.

Customers are comfortable having multiple banking relationships with a best-of-breed approach.\n\nA pressing question is: _How can Community FIs adopt digitization to keep pace with the best-in-class institutions_? Especially when instant credit introduces fresh risk and control complexities, which is worsened by the unpredictable payment behavior of consumers in the post-pandemic landscape.\n\nWelcome to the Digital Lending Revolution. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n### **Impact of Digitization on Consumer Expectations and FIs**\n\nToday\u2019s consumers expect instant gratification, including better contextual offers, quicker approval cycles and disbursement times. Should institutions lag in delivering on this expectation, they risk falling behind.\n\nFor the consumer \u2013 the landscape is rich with possibilities, as they are presented with many credit offers in real-time and have the freedom to select the optimal choice tailored to their specific needs and preferences. This means that Community FIs and sophisticated lenders are now contending for the very same consumers.\n\nThe competition to win and retain customers has intensified, prompting a continuous cycle of industry-wide innovation. Community FIs need to now rapidly invest in advanced digital technologies including decisioning and streamlined processes for acquisition\/retention for the best consumer experience. In a mature market, FIs now must set themselves apart to attract and retain consumers, as an exceptional digital consumer experience can be a crucial factor for their success.\n\nCertain FIs, often the first movers, have gained a competitive edge by already spending a few years upgrading talent, processes, and infrastructure. For the majority of the FIs that opted to follow suit, it becomes apparent that the transformation needed to compete effectively is anything but quick, especially when hindered by legacy processes and technology.\n\n### **Digital Lending: The What?**\n\nDigital Lending refers to an automated lending process, facilitating instantaneous loan discovery, approval and disbursal and subsequently digital customer management for servicing.\n\nAs the digital landscape continues to evolve, institutions are progressively depending more on sophisticated real-time analytics, automated approvals and workflow automation to run their lending lifecycles. By achieving faster turnaround times and expediting time-to-market, digital lending is enabling institutions to enhance and automate either the entire lending process or specific segments of it.\n\nHowever, where did this all begin?\n\nThe initial phase centered on automating loan originations \u2013 streamlining the assessment of applicant creditworthiness. Subsequently, the focus shifted to enhancing the customer experience, transitioning to a paperless approach with digitized e-signatures and contracts. This not only expedited processing but also enabled the tracking of compliance-related documentation.\n\nNow, best-in-class digital lending has developed into a complete end-to-end loan origination process \u2013 a seamlessly integrated solution that enhances the consumer experience, driven by all digital front-end orchestration and CRM, middleware decisioning logic and backend fulfillment, leveraging all digital tech.\n\n### **Major Growth Factors**\n\nNumerous factors are driving the expansion of digital lending and augmenting the customer experience.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_1ea9de686e62433799edde51c0d67e0a~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_28,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_1ea9de686e62433799edde51c0d67e0a~mv2.png)\n\n##### **1) Tech-Savvy Millennials & Gen-Z Reshaping the Market Dynamics**\n\nThe post-pandemic era witnessed a rapid transformation in consumer buying behavior. With the necessity of visiting physical stores diminishing, consumers now anticipate instant gratification across various domains, spanning from online food delivery and everyday essentials to instant credit.\n\nCombine this with the fact that tech-savvy Millennials and Gen Z now dominate as the largest generational groups in the U.S., and we\u2019ve got ourselves a seismic shift in the expectation of the financial industry. According to a [Morgan Stanley research](https:\/\/www.morganstanley.com\/ideas\/millennial-gen-z-loan-growth), Millennials are now the largest driver of net new-loan demand, and will remain so for the next decade.\n\nThis is both an opportunity and a challenge for Community FIs.\n\n**Upgrading decisioning capabilities, driving process efficiencies and enhancing analytical talent have become imperative steps for Community FIs to level the playing field effectively.**\n\n##### **2) Data and Analytical Sophistication**\n\nDigital data is everywhere. With nearly two-thirds of the global population having access to a smartphone, we are in the midst of a groundbreaking era of digital engagement. The result? A wealth of financial and non-financial data that FIs can harness for enhanced decision-making.\n\nAnalytical sophistication can drive data-driven offers and recommendations, dynamic pricing, early-detection of fraud, more precise risk assessments (credit, KYC, Fraud etc.) and better decisioning for prospecting and cross-selling. Amidst this wealth of data, FIs possess the potential to revolutionize the consumer experience.\n\n##### **3) Optimization of Speed and Cost**\n\nHarnessing technological advancements, digital lending has eliminated operational inefficiencies while significantly expediting the credit approval and dispersal process.\n\nBy implementing automated underwriting and approvals, financial institutions can now provide real-time credit offers, effectively eliminating time inefficiencies and significantly enhancing customer engagement. Moreover, they can easily monitor, test, learn, and adapt their strategies to ensure optimal outcomes. It is critically important to be nimble and react quickly to marketplace and prospect\/customer dynamics in real-time.\n\nThis process not only ensures shorter time-to-market, but also proves highly cost-effective, as automation mitigates the manual inefficiencies that often burden legacy lenders.\n\n### **How Does Digital Lending Differ from Traditional Lending?**\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_f47c375405204135a8caced453669659~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_28,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_f47c375405204135a8caced453669659~mv2.png)\n\nDigital credit consumers possess the agility to swiftly switch to their preferred lender \u2013 facilitated by the simple process of applying to numerous digital lenders at the same time. This stands in contrast to traditional lending, where consumers typically applied for loans physically, often at the bank where they held their deposits and payroll intake, through paper applications that took several days for a decision. If approved, consumers received the loan or credit card, which they then began utilizing.\n\nToday, consumers can simply go online, receive instantaneous offers from multiple banks upon submitting their application, and accept the most favorable one in real-time. For instance, they might choose one offer out of the four available. This scenario underscores the **concept of acceptance rate**: if a bank approves and extends offers to four consumer applications and one of them accepts, the bank\u2019s acceptance rate stands at 25%. This poses a significant challenge for all financial institutions. We will delve deeper into this concept in our next blog **.**\n\n### **Challenges of the Digital Lending Revolution**\n\nHaving navigated through the landscape of digital lending, let\u2019s now pivot to the challenges that Community FIs may encounter when embarking on this transformative journey.\n\n##### **1) Adopting a Fragmented Strategy over a Holistic Approach**\n\nThe most significant pitfall that financial institutions can encounter is tackling digitization in a fragmented fashion. Mere digitization or automation of isolated processes to address specific issues can lead to complexities, potentially necessitating a return to manual operations due to inadequate integration of these automated processes within the system. While the significant costs \u2013 in terms of both time and resources associated with a complete end-to-end transformation of lending solutions are understandable, it\u2019s often wiser to adopt a modular approach. This approach focuses on enhancing all the facets of a particular process \u2013 whether it\u2019s prospecting or underwriting.\n\n##### **2) Siloed Processes**\n\nFinancial institutions must prioritize the integration of all decision components within their ecosystem for seamless interaction and coordination. Siloed processes can lead to multiple inefficiencies and effectively delay time-to-market. In an increasingly competitive landscape, lenders should have the capability to access all necessary information on a unified platform in real-time to deliver hyper-personalized services to customers that can truly resonate with their financial needs and preferences. Without a comprehensive 360-degree customer view, financial institutions might struggle to enhance customer engagement and miss out on opportunities for effectively cross-selling new lending products.\n\n##### **3) Staying Compliant \u2013 \u2018Speed with Safety\u2019**\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of rules and regulations in the consumer lending industry, FIs may find it challenging to stay compliant without the support of a robust governance platform. Digital borrowers often divulge significant amounts of sensitive information while applying for loans \u2013 and automated processes, not humans, often drive loan decisions. Having system driven guardrails on a configurable platform to stay in compliance is critical \u2013 we call it \u2018speed with safety\u2019.\n\nWhile these represent the primary challenges faced by Community FIs, we\u2019ll delve deeper into these aspects in the upcoming second part of our series.

Using a process manager can simplify restarts, reboots,\nstatus-checks, logging, and configurations.\n\nThe process management tools that are frequently used are Systemd, init-script, etc. In general, it\nis recommended to use the tool that the OS provides to handle these tasks.\n\nTo simplify the installation, Supervisor can also be used, which provides application-level process\nmanagement that is independent of the host setup.\n\nThe tools available for process management require `sudo` access which might not be an option in some situations.\nCorridor has its own process manager for each of the components, which uses daemonisation to handle long-running,\nbackground processes.\n\n## Daemon Mode [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/technology\/self-hosting\/configurations\/process-management\/\\#daemon-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nNo additional configurations are required when running Corridor processes using Corridor-Daemons.\nWe can use the below set of commands to start\/stop\/check\\_status.\nThe logfile and pidfile for each process can be saved at custom locations by using the parameters:\n\n- logfile: location of the log file\n- pidfile: location of the pid file\n\nThe default logfile directory is: `INSTALL_DIR\/instances\/INSTANCE\/logs`\n\nThe default pidfile directory is: `INSTALL_DIR\/instances\/INSTANCE\/pids`\n\nTo start the processes, we can do:\n\n```md-code__content\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/corridor-api daemon start\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/corridor-worker daemon start\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-app\/corridor-app daemon start\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-jupyter\/corridor-jupyter daemon start\n\n```\n\nTo stop the processes, we can do:\n\n```md-code__content\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/corridor-api daemon stop\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/corridor-worker daemon stop\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-app\/corridor-app daemon stop\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-jupyter\/corridor-jupyter daemon stop\n\n```\n\nTo check the status of the processes, we can do:\n\n```md-code__content\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/corridor-api daemon status\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/corridor-worker daemon status\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-app\/corridor-app daemon status\nINSTALL_DIR\/venv-jupyter\/corridor-jupyter daemon status\n\n```\n\n## Supervisor [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/technology\/self-hosting\/configurations\/process-management\/\\#supervisor \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo use corridor with Supervisor, some useful configurations are:\n\n- `command`: The command to execute. Note, if 2 commands need to be executed, use `bash -c \"command1; command2\"`\n- `stdout_logfile`: Log file location for the stdout logs ( `%(program_name)s` and `%(process_num)01d` can be used as variables)\n- `stderr_logfile` or `redirect_stderr`: Log file location for the stderr logs, or redirect all the stderr logs to the stdout stream and hence have a common file for both\n- `user`: The user to run the process as\n- `environment`: The environment variables to be set before the process is run\n- `numprocs`: The number of processes to run\n\nHere are some example configuration files for the Corridor components:\n\n**Web Application server:**\n\n```md-code__content\n[program:corridor-app]\ncommand=INSTALL_DIR\/venv-app\/bin\/corridor-app run\nstdout_logfile=\/var\/log\/corridor\/%(program_name)s.log\nredirect_stderr=true\nuser=root\n\n```\n\n**API server:**\n\n```md-code__content\n[program:corridor-api]\ncommand=\n  bash -c \"INSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/bin\/corridor-api db upgrade && INSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/bin\/corridor-api run\"\nstdout_logfile=\/var\/log\/corridor\/%(program_name)s.log\nredirect_stderr=true\nuser=root\n\n```\n\n**API - Celery worker:**\n\n```md-code__content\n[program:corridor-worker-api]\ncommand=INSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/bin\/corridor-worker run --queue api\nenvironment=\n  C_FORCE_ROOT=1\nstdout_logfile=\/var\/log\/corridor\/%(program_name)s.log\nredirect_stderr=true\nuser=root\n\n```\n\n**Spark - Celery worker:**\n\n```md-code__content\n[program:corridor-worker-spark]\ncommand=INSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/bin\/corridor-worker run --queue spark --queue quick_spark\nenvironment=\n  C_FORCE_ROOT=1\nstdout_logfile=\/var\/log\/corridor\/%(program_name)s.log\nredirect_stderr=true\nuser=root\n\n```\n\n**Jupyter Notebook:**\n\n```md-code__content\n[program:corridor-jupyter]\ncommand=INSTALL_DIR\/venv-jupyter\/bin\/corridor-jupyter run\nstdout_logfile=\/var\/log\/corridor\/%(program_name)s.log\nredirect_stderr=true\nuser=root\n\n```\n\n## Systemd [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/technology\/self-hosting\/configurations\/process-management\/\\#systemd \"Permanent link\")\n\nMany Linux OS like RHEL have systemd pre-installed. To use systemd, the following steps need to be followed:\n\n- Add service file to systemd services folder. For example: `\/etc\/systemd\/system\/corridor.service`\n- To start service: `sudo systemctl start corridor`\n\n\nAnd to run the service on startup: `sudo systemctl enable corridor`\n\nHere are some example configuration files for the Corridor components:\n\n**Web Application server:**\n\n```md-code__content\n[Unit]\nDescription=Corridor Web Application\nAfter=syslog.target network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=root\nExecStart=\/bin\/bash -c 'INSTALL_DIR\/venv-app\/bin\/corridor-app run \\\n  >> \/var\/log\/corridor\/corridor-app.log 2>&1'\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n```\n\n**API server:**\n\n```md-code__content\n[Unit]\nDescription=Corridor API\nAfter=syslog.target network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=root\nExecStart=\/bin\/bash -c 'INSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/bin\/corridor-api run \\\n  >> \/var\/log\/corridor\/corridor-api.log 2>&1'\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n```\n\n**API - Celery worker:**\n\n```md-code__content\n[Unit]\nDescription=Corridor Worker API\nAfter=syslog.target network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=root\nExecStart=\/bin\/bash -c 'INSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/bin\/corridor-worker run --queue api \\\n  >> \/var\/log\/corridor\/corridor-worker-api.log 2>&1'\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n```\n\n**Spark - Celery worker:**\n\n```md-code__content\n[Unit]\nDescription=Corridor Worker Spark\nAfter=syslog.target network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=root\nExecStart=\/bin\/bash -c 'INSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/bin\/corridor-worker run --queue spark --queue quick_spark \\\n  >> \/var\/log\/corridor\/corridor-worker-spark.log 2>&1'\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n```\n\n**Jupyter Notebook:**\n\n```md-code__content\n[Unit]\nDescription=Corridor Jupyter\nAfter=syslog.target network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=root\nExecStart=\/bin\/bash -c 'INSTALL_DIR\/venv-api\/bin\/corridor-jupyter run \\\n  >> \/var\/log\/corridor\/corridor-jupyter.log 2>&1'\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n```\n\nWas this page helpful?","73","https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/technology\/self-hosting\/configurations\/process-management\/","Process Management - Corridor GGX Documentation","Platform Architecture and Technology","Evaluation #1","What are the benefits of using a process management tool?","Using a process management tool can simplify restarts, reboots, status-checks, logging, and configurations.

Pipeline Development** [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/register-and-refine\/\\#3-pipeline-development \"Permanent link\")\n\nDeveloping an AI pipeline is an iterative process aimed at rapidly building the first version of prompts, models, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) components to address a specific business use case. Once the initial version is ready, incremental improvements can be made by refining each component and analyzing performance gains.\n\n- **Crafting the Initial Prompt**\nDesigning an effective prompt is crucial for generating accurate and relevant responses. However, prompt engineering is an iterative process that requires multiple refinements as development progresses.\n\n- **Connecting to External Knowledge**\nEnhancing model responses with external knowledge sources improves contextual accuracy. In GenAI pipelines, this is achieved using RAG techniques. Building a robust RAG architecture ensures the pipeline retrieves the most relevant information, significantly impacting overall accuracy.\n\n- **Choosing the Best LLM for the Use Case**\nSelecting an optimal LLM depends on various factors such as the business problem, expected outcomes, cost, and operational efficiency.

When we create prompts for LLMs to handle complex tasks, the goal is to make intent as clear as possible. However, fully conveying every detail in one attempt is **extremely difficult**. The process often **involves repeated testing and refining, making small adjustments** until the model delivers the desired outcome.\n\nThis process of making changes testing impact and maintaining a clear track record of all the experiments can be challenging if done manually. The GGX Platform simplifies and automates this process by introducing **Hill Climbing** Experimentations.\n\n## What is Hill Climbing? [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/register-and-refine\/prompt-optimization\/\\#what-is-hill-climbing \"Permanent link\")\n\nHill Climbing is a method used to solve optimization problems by gradually improving a solution. It starts with an initial guess and makes small adjustments, keeping any changes that lead to a better result. This process continues until no further improvements can be made, similar to climbing a hill by always moving upward.\n\n## How It Works? [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/register-and-refine\/prompt-optimization\/\\#how-it-works \"Permanent link\")\n\n- **Initialization** \u2013 Start with an initial prompt.\n- **Evaluation** \u2013 Run an evaluation using fixed components:\n  - Predefined LLM with set hyperparameters\n  - Standardized metrics for performance measurement\n  - A consistent dataset for testing\n- **Modification** \u2013 Make small, targeted improvements to the prompt.\n- **Comparison** \u2013 Rerun the evaluation and measure performance changes.\n- **Update** \u2013 If the new prompt improves results, it becomes the new baseline.\n- **Iteration** \u2013 Repeat the process until the desired performance is achieved.\n\n## Benefits of Hill-Climbing Capability: [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/register-and-refine\/prompt-optimization\/\\#benefits-of-hill-climbing-capability \"Permanent link\")\n\n- The platform maintains **clear logs of all prompt updates** and their impact on model performance.\n- Once the best-performing prompt is identified, it can be **synced back** to the base pipeline.\n- Enables multiple team members to **collaborate simultaneously** on optimization.\n- **Customizable reports** for tracking the Hill-Climbing progress.\n\n> **Note:** The platform also provides flexibility to integrate external prompt optimizers like **[Google Prompt Optimizer](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/vertex-ai\/generative-ai\/docs\/learn\/prompts\/prompt-optimizer)**.\n\n## How to run Hill Climbing Tasks on Platform?

In addition, as need for changes are identified, banks need to move their strategies from analytics to production quickly while maintaining strict governance and robust compliance (ex: biases in decisions from updated strategies). This process needs to work iteratively as best-in-class vis-a-vis peer banks to create sustained advantage.\n\nThis is where [Corridor Platforms](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/), as the Decision Management \u2018rails\u2019 for CLI strategies can be a strategic enabler of competitive differentiation in the digital marketplace.\n\n### **What is Corridor Platforms?**\n\n[Corridor Platforms](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/) is a leading decision workflow governance and automation capability designed by industry veterans to rapidly transform risk and marketing decisioning at banks, enabling them to leverage new data, AI and automation to create competitive excellence in revenue growth, risk control and operating efficiency in the age of digitization. The platform offers [full connectivity between data, features, models and strategies with systemic governance and control](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/principle\/) at every step in the decision lifecycle.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_be232c150a7b47a6b57c203f73b33979~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_740,h_345,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_be232c150a7b47a6b57c203f73b33979~mv2.png)\n\n## **Developing a CLI Strategy on Corridor Platforms \u2013 a working example**\n\nIn this use case, we will showcase the development of a full blown CLI customer management policy on Corridor Platforms which leverages a sophisticated customer value framework and optimization strategy to create a custom CLI offer for existing credit card customers of the bank. The strategy also includes a customer eligibility criteria for CLI as well as a \u2018knock-off\u2019 or limits strategy to prune the optimized offers based on the banks risk tolerances.\n\n_Corridor has the ability to develop this policy at the customer level and hence manage the customer level exposure proactively and transparently from a risk\/reward perspective._\n\n### **Step 1 \u2013 Setup the data model in Corridor to capture the customer footprint flexibly**\n\nTo capture the customer footprint, the platform offers a flexible entity structure to map data from disparate sources in the customer lifecycle, like Customer, Loan and Performance tables. The platform also allows the policy writer to create custom entities (ex: segment) to roll up data on custom dimensions for features as well as powerful reporting on strategy performance.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_5fa0de3f51604ac4b3586c05f89b1960~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_73,h_26,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_5fa0de3f51604ac4b3586c05f89b1960~mv2.png)\n\n### **Step 2 \u2013 Creating powerful customer level features for CLI**\n\nPost the mapping of the tables and their relationships, the platform offers the capability to build powerful customer level features leveraging data across the relationship including complex aggregations and features based on offer related parameters. As an example, the feature below is used in a \u2018limits\u2019 strategy to calculate the max offer that can be given to the customer which does not breach the Debt-To-Income risk tolerance setup by the bank.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_7e358384845a4661b2f9ab9efb65e27d~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_24,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_7e358384845a4661b2f9ab9efb65e27d~mv2.png)\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_76c00dadce5d439bb22cb55c8c6b0b87~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_21,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_76c00dadce5d439bb22cb55c8c6b0b87~mv2.png)\n\nSimilarly, the policy writer can create powerful features based on the relationship footprint of the customer using data across different sources to develop relevant strategies, some examples are:\n\n- Earliest credit line opened with the bank (On\\_US)\n\n- Number of delinquencies in existing credit lines over last 6 months (On\\_US)\n\n- Total outstanding debt balance across all banking relationships (On\\_US + Off\\_US)\n\n\n1. The platform is able to stitch decision strategies easily and automatically across these disparate sources of data and provide an artifact for scoring, without the policy writer needing to manually stitch the solution together. More on this later.\n\n\n### **Step 3 \u2013 Creating an optimization framework for CLI offers**\n\nNext, the policy writer can set up a sophisticated custom framework on the platform to calculate the estimate of customer value if the CLI offer is taken up by the customer. The platform allows the policy writer complete flexibility in defining a custom logic. An illustration of such logic coded on the platform as a framework is below:\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_aa16d0118d5247a1952784665603a468~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_24,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_aa16d0118d5247a1952784665603a468~mv2.png)\n\nIn the example above, the framework takes the following category of inputs and produces an estimate of customer value (or profit).\n\n##### **Framework inputs**:\n\n- Fixed inputs to calculate revenue streams (ex: APR)\n\n- Forecasts of credit card balances and estimate losses over a predefined period.\n\n\n##### **Framework outputs:**\n\n- Estimate of customer value (or profit) which will be used in the CLI strategy (see below) to choose the best offer\n\n\n### **Step 4 \u2013 Develop a CLI strategy which leverages the features, models and framework on the platform**\n\nThe platform allows the policy writer to define a sophisticated optimization strategy which can execute in real-time (see next section) to cycle through a set of offers generated on the platform, and in this case, find the one offer which maximizes profit potential while offering the customer a CLI inline with their needs. The platform also enables the policy writer to write decisioning logic for eligibility criteria and limit strategies to prune the set of customers and offers respectively before presenting them through downstream systems.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_dcedf2d64a66470ba20a82ea31d991af~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_25,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_dcedf2d64a66470ba20a82ea31d991af~mv2.png)\n\n### **Step 5 \u2013 Stitch the artifact together for real time deployment easily on Corridor with flexible deployment options**\n\nThe platform automatically stitches together the entire decision artifact consisting of data, features, models, decision strategies as a standalone artifact which can be deployed flexibly in the banks.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_61dc7b40b3fe47e8b30968053645326b~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_77,h_35,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_61dc7b40b3fe47e8b30968053645326b~mv2.png)\n\n### **Step 6: Testing real time execution scenarios for CLI offers**\n\nThe platform also supports various options to experiment with policy decisioning & testing prior to final approvals. One capability is \u2018single-record\u2019 run which runs the real-time artifact for single customers as a way to test logic and iron out edge case issues. The platform provides full decision traceability to support debugging the policy prior to final deployment.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_ca4cb71b99c94e7382e18aa26b8956bf~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_25,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_ca4cb71b99c94e7382e18aa26b8956bf~mv2.png)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have demonstrated the ease of rapidly building a sophisticated CLI policy from scratch on Corridor Platforms where the policy writer is able to leverage sophisticated analytical building blocks like customer level features, forecast models and optimization frameworks to rapidly convert a blueprint into a working strategy and then quickly move to production without the need to re-test or re-code and compress the overall cycle time-to-market. The bank can also rapidly iterate the strategies based on performance data and evolve as the market and competitors evolve.\n\nThis can create a real competitive advantage in the marketplace for the banks to retain and deepen relationships with customers.\n\n[Bits & Banks - With Aditya Khandekar and Mike Kelly - Episode 3](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-and-mike-kelly-episode-3)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Reva Rao - Episode 2](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-reva-rao-episode-2)\n\n[Bits & Banks with Aditya Khandekar & Kevin Moss - Episode 1](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/post\/bits-banks-with-aditya-khandekar-kevin-moss)\n\n[Contact Us](https:\/\/www.corridorplatforms.com\/contact-us)\n\n[GenGuardX](https:\/\/ggx.corridorplatforms.com\/)\n\nbottom of page\n\nWe use cookies on our website to see how you interact with it.

In addition, as need for changes are identified, banks need to move their strategies from analytics to production quickly while maintaining strict governance and robust compliance (ex: biases in decisions from updated strategies). This process needs to work iteratively as best-in-class vis-a-vis peer banks to create sustained advantage.\n\nThis is where [Corridor Platforms](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/), as the Decision Management \u2018rails\u2019 for CLI strategies can be a strategic enabler of competitive differentiation in the digital marketplace.\n\n### **What is Corridor Platforms?**\n\n[Corridor Platforms](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/) is a leading decision workflow governance and automation capability designed by industry veterans to rapidly transform risk and marketing decisioning at banks, enabling them to leverage new data, AI and automation to create competitive excellence in revenue growth, risk control and operating efficiency in the age of digitization. The platform offers [full connectivity between data, features, models and strategies with systemic governance and control](https:\/\/corridorplatforms.com\/principle\/) at every step in the decision lifecycle.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_be232c150a7b47a6b57c203f73b33979~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_740,h_345,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_be232c150a7b47a6b57c203f73b33979~mv2.png)\n\n## **Developing a CLI Strategy on Corridor Platforms \u2013 a working example**\n\nIn this use case, we will showcase the development of a full blown CLI customer management policy on Corridor Platforms which leverages a sophisticated customer value framework and optimization strategy to create a custom CLI offer for existing credit card customers of the bank. The strategy also includes a customer eligibility criteria for CLI as well as a \u2018knock-off\u2019 or limits strategy to prune the optimized offers based on the banks risk tolerances.\n\n_Corridor has the ability to develop this policy at the customer level and hence manage the customer level exposure proactively and transparently from a risk\/reward perspective._\n\n### **Step 1 \u2013 Setup the data model in Corridor to capture the customer footprint flexibly**\n\nTo capture the customer footprint, the platform offers a flexible entity structure to map data from disparate sources in the customer lifecycle, like Customer, Loan and Performance tables. The platform also allows the policy writer to create custom entities (ex: segment) to roll up data on custom dimensions for features as well as powerful reporting on strategy performance.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_5fa0de3f51604ac4b3586c05f89b1960~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_73,h_26,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_5fa0de3f51604ac4b3586c05f89b1960~mv2.png)\n\n### **Step 2 \u2013 Creating powerful customer level features for CLI**\n\nPost the mapping of the tables and their relationships, the platform offers the capability to build powerful customer level features leveraging data across the relationship including complex aggregations and features based on offer related parameters. As an example, the feature below is used in a \u2018limits\u2019 strategy to calculate the max offer that can be given to the customer which does not breach the Debt-To-Income risk tolerance setup by the bank.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_7e358384845a4661b2f9ab9efb65e27d~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_24,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_7e358384845a4661b2f9ab9efb65e27d~mv2.png)\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_76c00dadce5d439bb22cb55c8c6b0b87~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_21,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_76c00dadce5d439bb22cb55c8c6b0b87~mv2.png)\n\nSimilarly, the policy writer can create powerful features based on the relationship footprint of the customer using data across different sources to develop relevant strategies, some examples are:\n\n- Earliest credit line opened with the bank (On\\_US)\n\n- Number of delinquencies in existing credit lines over last 6 months (On\\_US)\n\n- Total outstanding debt balance across all banking relationships (On\\_US + Off\\_US)\n\n\n1. The platform is able to stitch decision strategies easily and automatically across these disparate sources of data and provide an artifact for scoring, without the policy writer needing to manually stitch the solution together. More on this later.\n\n\n### **Step 3 \u2013 Creating an optimization framework for CLI offers**\n\nNext, the policy writer can set up a sophisticated custom framework on the platform to calculate the estimate of customer value if the CLI offer is taken up by the customer. The platform allows the policy writer complete flexibility in defining a custom logic. An illustration of such logic coded on the platform as a framework is below:\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_aa16d0118d5247a1952784665603a468~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_24,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_aa16d0118d5247a1952784665603a468~mv2.png)\n\nIn the example above, the framework takes the following category of inputs and produces an estimate of customer value (or profit).\n\n##### **Framework inputs**:\n\n- Fixed inputs to calculate revenue streams (ex: APR)\n\n- Forecasts of credit card balances and estimate losses over a predefined period.\n\n\n##### **Framework outputs:**\n\n- Estimate of customer value (or profit) which will be used in the CLI strategy (see below) to choose the best offer\n\n\n### **Step 4 \u2013 Develop a CLI strategy which leverages the features, models and framework on the platform**\n\nThe platform allows the policy writer to define a sophisticated optimization strategy which can execute in real-time (see next section) to cycle through a set of offers generated on the platform, and in this case, find the one offer which maximizes profit potential while offering the customer a CLI inline with their needs. The platform also enables the policy writer to write decisioning logic for eligibility criteria and limit strategies to prune the set of customers and offers respectively before presenting them through downstream systems.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_dcedf2d64a66470ba20a82ea31d991af~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_25,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_dcedf2d64a66470ba20a82ea31d991af~mv2.png)\n\n### **Step 5 \u2013 Stitch the artifact together for real time deployment easily on Corridor with flexible deployment options**\n\nThe platform automatically stitches together the entire decision artifact consisting of data, features, models, decision strategies as a standalone artifact which can be deployed flexibly in the banks.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_61dc7b40b3fe47e8b30968053645326b~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_77,h_35,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_61dc7b40b3fe47e8b30968053645326b~mv2.png)\n\n### **Step 6: Testing real time execution scenarios for CLI offers**\n\nThe platform also supports various options to experiment with policy decisioning & testing prior to final approvals. One capability is \u2018single-record\u2019 run which runs the real-time artifact for single customers as a way to test logic and iron out edge case issues. The platform provides full decision traceability to support debugging the policy prior to final deployment.\n\n![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/aa8fe1_ca4cb71b99c94e7382e18aa26b8956bf~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_49,h_25,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto\/aa8fe1_ca4cb71b99c94e7382e18aa26b8956bf~mv2.png)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have demonstrated the ease of rapidly building a sophisticated CLI policy from scratch on Corridor Platforms where the policy writer is able to leverage sophisticated analytical building blocks like customer level features, forecast models and optimization frameworks to rapidly convert a blueprint into a working strategy and then quickly move to production without the need to re-test or re-code and compress the overall cycle time-to-market.

Without a solid evaluation process, it is hard to tell if changes\u2014like tweaking prompts, removing LLMs, adjusting parameters, or refining retrieval steps\u2014are actually improving performance or breaking something. By measuring factors like relevance, hallucination rates, and latency, teams can make informed decisions about how to optimize their pipelines. Integrating evaluations into CI\/CD pipelines ensures that every update is tested, so performance stays consistent and issues are caught early.\n\nThe quality of an evaluation depends on having a well-rounded dataset and metrics. If test cases are too limited, models might appear to perform well but fail in real-world scenarios. A diverse dataset ensures that evaluation metrics truly reflect how the model will behave in production. At the end of the day, evaluations help build trust, keeping LLM applications accurate, scalable, and dependable across different use cases.\n\n## Choosing the Right Evaluation Method [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/evaluate-and-approve\/\\#choosing-the-right-evaluation-method \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are two main types of evaluators for assessing LLM performance: **automated evaluation** (using LLMs or code) and **human annotations**.

Without a solid evaluation process, it is hard to tell if changes\u2014like tweaking prompts, removing LLMs, adjusting parameters, or refining retrieval steps\u2014are actually improving performance or breaking something. By measuring factors like relevance, hallucination rates, and latency, teams can make informed decisions about how to optimize their pipelines. Integrating evaluations into CI\/CD pipelines ensures that every update is tested, so performance stays consistent and issues are caught early.\n\nThe quality of an evaluation depends on having a well-rounded dataset and metrics. If test cases are too limited, models might appear to perform well but fail in real-world scenarios. A diverse dataset ensures that evaluation metrics truly reflect how the model will behave in production. At the end of the day, evaluations help build trust, keeping LLM applications accurate, scalable, and dependable across different use cases.\n\n## Choosing the Right Evaluation Method [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/evaluate-and-approve\/\\#choosing-the-right-evaluation-method \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are two main types of evaluators for assessing LLM performance: **automated evaluation** (using LLMs or code) and **human annotations**. Each method serves a different purpose depending on the type of assessment needed.\n\n| Method | How it Works | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Automated (LLM or Code-Based)** | Uses an LLM to evaluate another LLM\u2019s output or code to measure accuracy, performance, or behavior. | \\- Fast, scalable qualitative evaluation. <br> \\- Reducing cost and latency. <br> \\- Automating evaluations with hard-coded criteria (e.g., code generation). |\n| **Human Annotations** | Experts manually review and label LLM outputs. | \\- Evaluating automated evaluation methods. <br> \\- Applying subject matter expertise for nuanced assessments. <br> \\- Providing real-world application feedback. |\n\nAutomated evaluation is efficient for objective assessments and large-scale testing, while human annotations provide deeper insights at a higher cost. Combining both methods can ensure a balanced and reliable evaluation process.\n\n## GenAi Evaluation Framework [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/evaluate-and-approve\/\\#genai-evaluation-framework \"Permanent link\")\n\nGen AI pipelines can introduce significant risks, making a robust evaluation framework essential for comprehensive testing and validation. Follow these structured steps to ensure effective evaluation:\n\n| Step | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Identify Risks & Define Evaluation Scope** | \\- Assess potential risks across the pipeline. <br> \\- Create a comprehensive list of necessary evaluations. |\n| **Define Evaluation Metrics** | \\- Align metrics with business objectives, MRM, and FL requirements. <br> \\- Implement custom metrics as needed. <br> \\- Use GGX evaluation reports curated by GenAI and risk experts. |\n| **Prepare Evaluation Datasets** | \\- Ensure datasets accurately represent the use case. <br> \\- Cover all critical business scenarios for thorough validation. <br> \\- Utilize GGX datasets curated by experts to evaluate risks. |\n| **Run Evaluations** | \\- Use standard\/custom reports and dashboards for structured testing. <br> \\- Interpret evaluation results to refine and enhance the pipeline. |\n| **Compare with Challengers** | \\- Establish alternative components and pipelines for comparison. |\n\nBy following these steps, teams can systematically evaluate their Gen AI pipelines, mitigate risks, and enhance performance with data-driven insights.\n\nCorridor provides the ability to **Run Evaluation Jobs** for registered GenAi components.\n\n## Introduction to Jobs [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/evaluate-and-approve\/\\#introduction-to-jobs \"Permanent link\")\n\nCorridor provides the ability to perform evaluations by running jobs on the registered objects and generating standardised and customized reports\/metrics. Evaluations are controlled by Corridor - and run in a dedicated locked environment to ensure reproducibility of results.\n\nThe platform supports batch evaluation of objects through **simulation jobs** or **comparisons with similar objects** on given datasets. Reports and metrics for these evaluations can be customized within Corridor under **Resources \u2192 Reports Section**. For more details, refer to the [Reporting](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/evaluate-and-approve\/reporting\/) section.\n\nOnce the job is completed, Corridor records all the details about specific steps of the jobs, logs resource usages and publishes the dashboard containing all the selected reports which can be shared across the team on Corridor for feedback and approval process. The results can be exported outside Corridor or used for automated documentation.\n\n## Approvals post Evaluations [\u00b6](https:\/\/ggx-docs.corridorplatforms.com\/evaluate-and-approve\/\\#approvals-post-evaluations \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe approval process is a key governance capability of the platform.

What should leading institutions consider as they evaluate how to safeguard against unintended risks and consequences resulting from generative AI?\n\n\"Project GGX builds upon our team\u2019s success implementing the first AI risk decisioning and governance suite fit for large, regulated entities,\u201d said [Manish Gupta](https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corridorplatforms.com%2Fabout-us&esheet=53906598&newsitemid=20240307784920&lan=en-US&anchor=Manish+Gupta&index=3&md5=30f4710ed00660dbdbb2db4a6998326a), Founder and CEO of Corridor Platforms. \u201cWe aim to collaborate with industry first-movers to demonstrate new analytical techniques and risk management processes that leading firms can consider as they weigh how to use this powerful new technology safely. Along the way, we also look forward to contributing to the open source community in hopes of bringing the industry closer to making scaled GenAI use cases in financial services a reality.\u201d\n\n> Oliver Wyman Global Head of Capabilities, [Michael Zeltkevic](https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oliverwyman.com%2Four-culture%2Four-people%2Fmichael-zeltkevic.html&esheet=53906598&newsitemid=20240307784920&lan=en-US&anchor=Michael+Zeltkevic&index=4&md5=6ae926d04dd477866185cd7c00f4649d) said, \u201cThe purpose of Project GGX is to begin to chart a practical test-and-learn approach on GenAI usage that addresses today\u2019s challenge of turning GenAI pilots into scaled, enterprise-safe deployments. We are best positioned to execute this initiative given the combined depth of specialization across our joint team members, building upon Oliver Wyman\u2019s multi-decade heritage as a financial services risk management advisor and Corridor\u2019s leading technology capabilities.\u201d\n\nGenAI presents new opportunities to streamline many business processes, improve workforce productivity, and in some cases, opens the door to entirely new business models. However, most companies have not yet adopted the technology at scale, in large part due to the novel risks it presents and the many unknowns that remain. The powerful combination of Oliver Wyman's leading risk management capabilities and Corridor\u2019s world class technology platform aims to help fill this gap by understanding how to test for, measure, and monitor novel risks that GenAI presents. The result of the work will illustrate the complexities of embedding GenAI in risk management processes and serve as a live case study to advancing the industry dialogue on how to practically deploy this novel technology.\n\n**About Corridor Platforms**\n\nCorridor Platforms is a leading provider of next-gen decision workflow governance and automation software.
