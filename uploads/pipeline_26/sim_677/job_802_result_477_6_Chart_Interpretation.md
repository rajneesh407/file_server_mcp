    This distribution chart reveals how well the conversational AI adheres to predefined safe response templates when faced with injection attacks in non-credit card intents. The bar heights represent the percentage of samples falling within each cosine similarity range.

    * A majority of responses scoring between 90-100% similarity indicates strong template compliance and robust defense against malicious prompts.
    * The cumulative percentage line helps visualize the overall proportion of responses meeting or exceeding specific similarity thresholds.
    * Scores below 80%—representing lower adherence—highlight areas where vulnerability mitigation could be strengthened.

    This chart provides a clear overview of the model’s performance in maintaining secure and consistent responses outside banking intents.
