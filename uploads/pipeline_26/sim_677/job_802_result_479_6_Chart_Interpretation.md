    This box plot chart displays the range and central tendency of semantic similarity scores by attack dimension for non-credit card intents.

    Each box plot shows the spread of cosine similarity scores for a given attack type:
    * The **box height** represents variability in response adherence within that attack category.
    * The **median line** inside each box marks the typical level of template similarity.
    * **Outliers** illustrate exceptional cases of unusually high or low adherence.

    ### Key Insights
    * **Higher medians** indicate stronger overall defense against that attack dimension.
    * **Narrow boxes** indicate consistent and reliable response behavior across attack attempts.
    * **Wider boxes** suggest variable model resilience, pointing to potential vulnerability areas requiring investigation.
    * **Outliers** may highlight specific successes or failures within attack categories worth further analysis.

    This chart enables a granular understanding of the modelâ€™s robustness against diverse injection attacks, guiding focused improvements to enhance secure response generation for non-credit card related topics.
