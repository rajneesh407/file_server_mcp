    This bar chart presents the rate of successful jailbreaks by attack dimension for non-credit card intents:

    * Each barâ€™s height represents the percentage of tested responses that violated security guidelines within that attack category.
    * Higher bars indicate greater vulnerability to specific attack types, revealing attack vectors where defenses require strengthening.
    * Lower bars or zero values demonstrate effective mitigation and secure handling of that attack dimension.

    ### Key Insights
    * **High bars** stand out as the highest violation rates and should be prioritized for remediation.
    * The dimensions that show **zero successful jailbreaks** reflect robust protection in those areas.
    * **Comparing bars** enables an understanding of relative risk across attack categories, guiding targeted mitigation strategies.

    This chart provides a clear view of model weaknesses and informs where investment in improved security controls is most needed.
