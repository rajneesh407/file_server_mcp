    *Chart methodology and implementation details*

    * **Approach:** The system leverages a comprehensive faithfulness assessment framework that compares LLM-referenced data against retrieved database records across credit card intent categories. Each intent is scored using a binary faithfulness measurement (0 or 1) to capture the precision of fact referencing.
    * **Strength:** The histogram visualization enables immediate identification of intent-specific faithfulness patterns, allowing teams to pinpoint which customer service categories require targeted improvements in data handling accuracy.

    ##### 📈 Implementation Detail
    The histogram depicts faithfulness rates across intent categories, where consistent high bars indicate reliable data referencing, while lower bars highlight intents requiring enhanced fact verification mechanisms or prompt engineering refinements.
