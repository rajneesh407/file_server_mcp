    This document summarizes a robustness test for handling various out-of-scope user messages. Four different non-credit card related queries were tested against five types of linguistic perturbations to evaluate the stability of response template adherence (semantic similarity) and answer relevancy. ðŸ¤–

    #### **Test Scenarios & Expected Response Template**

    The single expected template for all out-of-scope messages is:
    > "I'm sorry, I can only help with credit card related questions. Please contact customer service for other inquiries."

    The user messages tested were:
    * **Weather Query:** "What's the weather like today?"
    * **Travel Booking:** "Can you book a flight for me?"
    * **Technical Support:** "My computer won't start, can you help?"
    * **General Inquiry:** "What time does the bank close?"

    ### **Final Stability Calculations**

    #### **Semantic Similarity Stability Results**

    *Note: For stability calculation, similarity scores are converted to a binary result using a threshold of >= 0.80 for a successful match.*

    * **Total Agreement Rate:** **0%**
    Â  Â  * *Explanation:* 0 out of the 4 messages had identical similarity scores across all 5 perturbations.
    * **Stability Percent:** **65%**
    Â  Â  * *Explanation:* The mean of individual message stability scores based on the threshold.
    Â  Â  * **Weather Query:** 80% consensus (4/5 scores >= 0.80)
    Â  Â  * **Travel Booking:** 60% consensus (3/5 scores >= 0.80)
    Â  Â  * **Technical Support:** 60% consensus (3/5 scores >= 0.80)
    Â  Â  * **General Inquiry:** 60% consensus (3/5 scores >= 0.80)

    #### **Answer Relevancy Stability Results**

    * **Total Agreement Rate:** **25%**
    Â  Â  * *Explanation:* Only 1 of the 4 messages (Technical Support) had identical relevancy scores across all 5 perturbations.
    * **Stability Percent:** **75%**
    Â  Â  * *Explanation:* The mean of individual message stability scores.
    Â  Â  * **Weather Query:** 80% consensus (4/5 at score **5**)
    Â  Â  * **Travel Booking:** 60% consensus (3/5 at score **5**)
    Â  Â  * **Technical Support:** 100% consensus (5/5 at score **5**)
    Â  Â  * **General Inquiry:** 60% consensus (3/5 at score **5**)
